#### 30. RDF (Resource Description Framework)

***Theorem 30.1.*** Resource Description Framework

- Definition

  - `Semantic web`

    - Also known as web 3.0, which is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards. 
    - The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.

  - `Resource Description Framework (RDF)` 

    - Several technologies are required to make the semantic web works
      - A **data structure** in which to make computer-readable statements
      - An RDF document is a set of statements
  
  - `Statement` - asserts something about a resource, sometimes its relation to another resource, consists of three parts:
  
    - The **subject** of the statement: what resource the statement is about, e.g. https://transtechsocial.org/news
    - The **object** of the statement: what resource or value the subject is related to, e.g. Angelica Ross
    - The **predicate** of the statement: how the subject and object are related, e.g. contributor
  
    > We can write an RDF statement in such format: 
    >
    > `subject` `predicate` `object`. 
  
  - `Resource` - The **subjects** of RDF statements, or sometimes the **objects**
  
    - Identifiable by a URI
  
      > e.g.
      >
      > - A webpage or other web-accessible document or service
      > - A physical thing, such as a person, organisation or book
      > - An abstract concept, e.g. being happy or the number pi
  
    - URIs are also used to give unique identifiers for the predicates of RDF statements, e.g. creator
  
    - Write an URI in a statement between <...> brackets
  
      > e.g.
      >
      > `<https://transtechsocial.org/news>`
      >
      > `<https://missross.com/>`
  
  - `Vocabularies` - A **set of terms** defined together to allow descriptions in some particular domain, similar to namespaces
  
    - Each term is a URI, and all the URIs in a vocabulary start with the same string
  
      > e.g.
      >
      > The vocabulary `http://purl.org/dc/terms/` describes who created and published resources, at what times, and similar library data, including terms such as:
      >
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator` – relates a resource to its creator
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher` – relates a resource to its publisher
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor` - relates a resource to an entity responsible for making contributions to it
  
  - `Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)` - The **format** for RDF statements that can be encoded in different formats, including XML. 
  
  - `Prefixs` - we will often abbreviate them using prefixes instead of URI, where the prefix replaces the vocabulary URI
  
    - `dc:creator` means the URI that `dc: maps` to combined with “creator”
  
    >e.g. 
    >
    >- **Prefix doi** - means mapped to https://doi.org/
    >
    >- **Prefix dc** - means mapped to http://purl.org/dc/terms/
    >
    >- **Prefix orcid** - means mapped to https://orcid.org/
  
  - `Values` - The objects of RDF statements **do not have to be URIs, but can be data values** instead
  
    >e.g.
    >
    >For example, the following says that the first name of the resource **inf:rgreener** (a person) is “Robert”
    >
    >`inf:rgreener  foaf:firstName  “Robert” .`
  
- RDF graphs

  - A set of RDF statements is often called an RDF graph, because the information forms a graph with the **resources and values as nodes** and **the predicates as edges**
  - GraphDB - a modern type of database, stores data in a graph sturcture


***Theorem 31.2.*** RDFa

- Semantic web pages

  - While **RDF can be stored in triple stores**, the original intention of the semantic web was to provide the machine-readable knowledge alongside the human-readable web

    > i.e., To realise the semantic web, we need to specify how RDF can be **embedded inside HTML pages using mark-up**

  - The RDF data is not presented to the user, but can be **extracted from the webpage by software**

- RDFa - Allows RDF to be **embedded in HTML files**

  - If we add a **property** attribute to an element marking up text, the attribute value is a predicate relating the webpage to the text

  > e.g. 
  >
  > for `http://www.example.org/index.html` if it contains
  >
  > ```html
  > <h1 property="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"> 
  >   Angelica Ross, Black transgender star of Pose: 'Technology saved my life'
  > </h1>
  > ```
  >
  > Then the following RDF statement is embedded in the page
  >
  > ```
  > <http://www.example.org/index.html>
  >       <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title>
  >             “Angelica Ross, Black transgender
  >              star of Pose:
  >              'Technology saved my life'”
  > ```

- Multiple subjects

  -  The subject of all the embedded RDF statements **can be the webpage itself** 

  - We can **also embed arbitrary RDF, with any subject**

    - To do this, we use the **resource** attribute to say which subject resource we are making statements about within a given HTML element

    >  e.g. 
    >
    > ```
    > <p resource =
    > “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pose_(TV_series)”>
    > ```
    >
    > means that the statements embedded in this `<p>` element are not about the webpage, but about the Pose TV series.

#### 31. Ontologies

###### ***Theorem 31.1.*** Ontologies

- Definition

  - `Ontologies` - Data which encodes the meaning of resources to reason the statements

    > **RDF allows us to make statements about resources** that can be read by software. 
    >
    > However, **It does not, by itself, allow the software to “reason” about the statements** to determine how best to apply the information

    - Need to encode something about the **meaning of the resources** *(like the type of things)* to allow this

  - `Web Ontology Language (OWL)` - A language for encoding ontologies in RDF

    - Defines a **vocabulary of terms**
    - Defines how those terms relate to each other, **so as to give extra meaning for software to reason** over using components called **reasoners**
    - OWL is itself a vocabulary for defining the meaning of terms

###### ***Theorem 31.2.*** Classes and individuals in OWL

- Class

  - Allows us to make is to say what **class** a resource belongs to, 

    i.e. what kind of thing it is, using the **predicate** `rdf:type`

    >e.g. 
    >
    >the statement below says that **inf:simonm is a kind of person**, 
    >
    >i.e. an **instance of the class `ex:Person`**
    >
    >`inf:simonm rdf:type ex:Person  .`

  - The URI `ex:Person` is a term in our ontology, representing the class of all people

- Indiviuals

  - `inf:simonm` is said to be an **individual**, because it is a specific thing in the world

  - `rdf:type` is so common it is abbreviated as **a**

    >`inf:simonm a ex:Person  .`

- Multiple Classes

  - A **resource can be an instance of multiple classes**

  - `inf:simonm` is not only a person, but a reader and a man

    >e.g.
    >
    >```
    >inf:simonm a  ex:Person ;
    >           a  ex:Reader ;
    >           a  ex:Man .
    >```

  - Our ontology can say that `ex:Man` is a **subclass** of `ex:Person`, so reasoners can automatically determine that any resource that is a man is also a person

    >e.g.
    >
    >`ex:Man rdfs:subclassOf ex:Person .`

- Class hierarchies

  - Ontologies generally include hierarchies of subclass relationships between many class terms

    >e.g.
    >
    >```
    >ex:Man     rdfs:subclassOf    ex:Person .
    >ex:Woman   rdfs:subclassOf    ex:Person .
    >ex:Mother  rdfs:subclassOf    ex:Woman .
    >```

  - From the above subclass relations, a reasoner could <u>determine that any instance of the class `ex:Mother` is also an instance of the class `ex:Person`</u>

    >e.g.
    >
    >`inf:mary   a   ex:Mother .` implies
    >
    >`inf:mary   a   ex:Woman, ex:Person .`

- Properties

  >e.g.
  >
  >`inf:simonm ex:worksIn ex:London .`

  - the predicate above, `ex:worksIn`, is called a **property**
  - We can say that `ex:worksIn` only makes sense if it is relating a person (the **domain** of the property) to a city (the **range** of the property)

  >e.g.
  >
  >`ex:worksIn rdfs:domain ex:Person ; rdfs:range ex:City .`

- Datatypes

  - We used **XML Schema data types** to state the range in these cases

  >e.g.
  >
  >`ex:hasName rdfs:range xs:string .`

- Mapping ontologies

  - OWL provides **vocabulary** to help map between two different ontologies

  > e.g. 
  >
  > `my:Person owl:equivalentClass your:Human .`
  >
  > Where `my:Person` and `your:Human` are two different ontologies. 

  - We can similarly say that one individual **is the same as** another individual by using `owl:sameAs`, just identified with a different URI

#### 32. Querying Ontologies

###### ***Theorem 32.1.*** SPARQL

- Definition
  - `SPARQL` - an **SQL-like standard query language** for RDF
    - To **extract knowledge** from stores of RDF data (**triple stores**), we need to query them, as with any other database
    - There is the SPARQL Protocol, for sending queries to online triple stores and returning the query results
  
- SPARQL queries
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > The query below returns the name and email address for any resource (person) for which we have that information
  >
  > ```
  > PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
  > SELECT ?name ?mbox
  > WHERE
  >       {  ?x  foaf:name  ?name .
  >          ?x  foaf:mbox  ?mbox  }
  > ```
  
  - Purpose
    - finds all the statements, or combinations of statements, following a particular pattern, and 
    - returns some subjects and/or objects of those statements
  
  - Pattern variables - represent the parts of the data we are looking to retrieve
    - If we were querying for statements matching the pattern “any resource for which we have a name and an email address”, we need three variables for the resource, the name and the email address
  
    - Use the form **?var** or **$var** for a variable name
  
      >e.g.
      >
      >```
      > {  ?x  foaf:name  ?name .
      >         ?x  foaf:mbox  ?mbox  }
      >```
  
  - Query results
  
    - Can be seen as a table, with the column headings as variable names and cells as values
  
    - Each row is one set of bindings for the variables that when placed into the query pattern gives some RDF found in the triple store
  
      >e.g.
      >
      >| ?name         | ?mbox                   |
      >| ------------- | ----------------------- |
