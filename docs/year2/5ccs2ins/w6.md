#### 23. Markup Languages

###### ***Theorem 23.1.*** Introduction on marking-up

- Definition

  - `marking-up text` - adding annotations around pieces of it to explicitly indicate properties of those pieces.
  - `mark-up` - Used to aid people to know how to present the text on a page. 
  - `eXtensible Markup Language (XML)` - A general-purpose mark-up langauge for organising, storing and transferring data.

- Mark-up Languages - A format for a document where text is annotated (marked-up) 

  Annotations with computer-parseable information are on:

  - how the text should be **interpreted**, 
  - how it should be **presented**, 
  - how one piece of text **relates** to another, etc.

###### ***Theorem 23.2.*** Marking-up in HTML vs. XML

- Mark-up in HTML

  >e.g.
  >
  >```html
  ><html>
  >  	<body>
  >    		<h1> All the annotations are marking-up text </h1>
  >  	</body>
  ></html>
  >```

  - HTML is a particular mark-up language. 
  - Links to other pages (resources) and the presentational structure are both encoded in mark-up annotations to the text of the web page.

- Mark-up in XML

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```xml
  > <?xml version = “1.0”?>
  > <chapter>
  > 	<title>Introduction to Mark-up</title>
  > 	Marking up text means adding annotations around pieces of it to explicitly indicate properties of those pieces. The mark-up was originally to aid people,<newterm>mark-up men</newterm>, to know how to present the text on a page. In <technical>HTML</technical>, it is still used for this purpose. <technical>XML</technical> generalises from this, so that mark-up is specific for the purposes of each application. Notice that, as long as mark-up does not overlap, it describes a hierarchy of annotations.
  > </chapter>
  > ```

  - XML is another mark-up language. 
  - Tags describe the structure of content.

#### 24. Introduction to Web Development and HTML

###### ***Theorem 24.1.*** Basic concepts on Web Development

- The World Wide Web (WWW) consisting with: 

  >> The Web: 
  >>
  >> `HTML` | `CSS` | `Web APIs` & `JavaScript``
  >>
  >> ``HTTP`
  >
  >`TCP` | `TLS` | `IP` | `DNS` & `UDP` , etc. 

  - ` Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)`

  - `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)`
  - JavaScript

- Web Development

  | ...                         |           |          |            |

###### ***Theorem 24.2.*** Hypertext and HTML

- Definition
  - `Hypertext` - text which includes **links** to other text, so that the text branches and can be read via **multiple paths**. 
    - A term coined by Ted Nelson in the 1960s. 
    - Is **non-linear**. (Books, newspaper articles etc. (linear) are written to be read from top to bottom, left to right (or right to left))
    - In a web page, when you click on a link you issue a request to download the linked page. 
    - Are encoded in HTML. 
  - `Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)` - the language that **web pages (resources)** are written in (also other simple formatted documents)
    - Has pre-defined **elements and attributes** - describing the **structure** of a web page and how it should be **presented** in a browser. 
    - While visiting a page in a **web browser**, **HTTP (over TCP/IP)** is used to <u>download the resource or HTML document from the server</u>. 
    - An XML-like language for encoding **hypertext documents**. 
- HTML 5 and backwards compatibility
  - **HTML 5** - the current standard for HTML
    - Can be written in the form of HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. 
    - Provides additional elements and attributes to allow easier video embedding, typesetting document sections, new form input elements, and many other changes. 
  - **HTML 4.01** - almost, but not quite, XML, since
    - Not every element needs a closing tag in HTML
    - XHTML 1.0 is a fully XML version of HTML and the difference between XHTLM 1.0 and HTML 4.01 is small.
  - **WHATWG** have produces a Living Standard of HTML which inlcudes new elements. 

###### ***Theorem 24.3.*** The Structure of an HTML file

>e.g. 
>
>```html
><html>
>	<head>
>    <title>My first webpage</title>
>  </head>
>  <body>
>    	...
>  </body>
></html>
>```

- Root element `<html>` for every HTML document. 

- Two elements in the document

  - The head `<head>` - contains information about the document, including its name (`<title>`). 

  - The body `<body>` - contains the content of the webpage/document.

    - Text in the body appears in a browser viewing the document.

    - By default the browser will ignore whitespace.

      > e.g. 
      >
      > ```html
      > <body>		Hello.
      > 					My name is 				Samhar.
      > </body>
      > ```
      >
      > Will appear as
      >
      > ```
      > Hello. My name is Samhar. 
      > ```

    - In HTML5, `<pre>` allows pre-formatted content and then the browser consider all the line breaks and spaces from the source code. 

###### ***Theorem 24.4.*** HTML Markup

- Structural mark-up

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```html
  > <H1>text</H1> <!-- The text inside the element is a heading -->
  > <P>text</P> <!-- The text will appear as a paragraph -->
  > ```

  - The text can be marked-up with elements stating **structural detail**. 
  - HTML 5 adds more such elements, including `<SECTION>` to distinguish a section of a document

- Presentational mark-up

  >e.g. 
  >
  >```html
  ><!-- A line break will appear between the text-->
  ><BR/>
  >
  ><!-- Show the text in bold-->
  ><B>text</B>
  ><STRONG>text</STRONG>
  >
  ><!-- Show the text in italics -->
  ><I>text</I>
  ><EMPHASIZE>text</EMPHASIZE>
  >
  ><!-- Using CSS style for text-align in HTML5 -->
  ><p style="text-align:center">This is a centralised paragraph.</p>
  >```

- Lists - hierarchical element structure allows for structured presentational mark-up. 

  >e.g.
  >
  >```html
  ><!-- Show the content as a bullet(unordered) list -->
  ><ul>
  >    	<li>A</li>
  >    	<li>B</li>
  ></ul>
  >
  ><!-- Show the content as a ordered list -->
  ><ol>
  >	<li>A</li>
  >  	<li>B</li>
  ></ol>
  >```

- Tables - more element nesting allows for complex structures

  >e.g.
  >
  >```html
  ><table>
  >  	<tr>
  >    		<td> A </td>
  >    		<td> B </td>
  >  	</tr>
  >  	<tr>
  >    		<td> C </td>
  >    		<td> D </td>
  >  	</tr>
  ></table>
  >```
  >
  >Will appear like
  >
  >```
  >| A | B |
  >| C | D |
  >```

  - Tables are split into rows by `<tr>`, then cells by `<td>`. 

- Images

  >e.g.
  >
  >```html
  ><img src =
  >“pictures/samhar.gif”/>
  >```

  - Can be included in a document with an `<img>` element. 

  - **SRC attribute** gives the URL where to load the image from. 

    (often a relative URL as the image will be on the same server as the page)

  - The URL is used by the browser to download the image using an **HTTP GET request**. 

- Links - hypertext document contains links to other documents

  >e.g.
  >
  >```html
  >You can find the Department homepage
  ><a href = “https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics”>here</a>
  >```
  >
  >Will appear as
  >
  >You can find the Department homepage [here]()

  - A piece of text in the document is marked up to be a link with the `<a>` element. 
  - The linked URL is given in the **HREF attribute**

- Fragment anchors - name a **position in a document**

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```html
  > <a id=”cats”/>This section of the page describes cats...
  > 
  > <!-- To link to an anchor of a page at a given URL, -->
  > <!-- add #anchor to the end of the URL -->
  > <a href=“http://animals.com/all.html#cats”>cats</a>
  > ```

  - Useful to <u>link to a position</u> in a large document, so the user goes to the right text. 
  - Uses `<a>` with the **ID attribute**. 

---

#### 25. HTML Forms

###### ***Theorem 25.1.*** HTML form elements

- `form` - part of an HTML page. It contains the following components: 
  - A `<form>` element
    - Specify among other things what kind of HTTP method will be used, and
    - Specify the server/destination of that request.
  - One or more of the following elements: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, etc. 
    - Every input has a **name** attribute and a **type** attribute. 
    - Different types of input have different attributes and content. 
  - A specific `<input>` element - adding a button to submit the form data. 

>e.g. 
>
>Form input: 
>
>```html
><!-- Input text box for post code with space for 7 characters without max length -->
><input type=”text” name=”postcode” size=”7”/>
>
><!-- Input box with hidden entry for passwords -->
><input type=”password” name=”pass”/>
>
><!-- Drop-down selection list with 3 options but showing only 1 row -->
> <select name = ”eyecolour” size = ”1”>
>      <option>Black</option>
>      <option>Green</option>
>      <option>Brown</option>
></select>
>```
>
>Form submission:  
>
>```html
><!-- Add a submit button -->
><input type = ”submit” value=“Submit” />
>
><!-- On clicking the submit button, the form data is sent by HTTP to the URL -->
><!-- given as the form's action attribute that will process its data -->
><form action="/personalData" method="GET"/>
>```

###### ***Theorem 25.2.*** HTTP mthods of submission: **GET** and **POST**

- Encoded form data

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```html
  > <!DOCTYPE html>
  > <html>
  > <body>
  > <form action="personalData" method="GET" />
  > 
  >   <label for="fullname">Full name:</label> 
  >   <input type = "text" name = "fullname" size = "32" /><br>
  >   
  > 	<label> Eye colour:
  > 		<select name = "eyecolour" size = "1"> 
  >       <option>Black</option> 
  >       <option>Green</option> 			
  >       <option>Brown</option>
  > 		</select>
  >   </label><br>
  >   
  > 	<input type = "submit" value="Submit" /> 
  > </form>
  > </body>
  > </html>
  > ```
  >
  > When enter the name `Samhar Mahmoud` and select eye color `Brown`, click sumbit, the data will be encoded as
  >
  > `/personalData?fullname=Samhar+Mahmoud&eyecolour=Brown`

  - Form data is sent by default **in an encoded form**, whose MIME type is *application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. 

    But when an input of the type file is used in the form, the enctype should be set to *multipart/form-data* and the method should be **POST**. 

  - When the data is encoded as *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* :

    - For every input on the form, a string is created of the form: `InputName=InputValue`. 
    - **Spaces** in the input values are converted into **+**. 
    - Any other characters in the input values that are not allowed in URLs are converted into their **ASCII hexadecimal form**, e.g. %27 for apostrophe
    - The input strings are **concatenated** together with **&**

- HTTP form submission methods

  >e.g.
  >
  >```
  ><!-- Example for GET -->
  >GET /personalData?fullname=Samhar+Mahmoud&eyecolour=Brown HTTP/1.1
  >Host: www.example.com:8080
  >Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml
  >Accept-Language: en-gb,en-us
  >Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8
  >Connection: keep-alive
  >```
  >
  >```
  ><!-- Example for POST -->
  >POST /personalData HTTP/1.1
  >Host: www.example.com:8080
  >Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml
  >Accept-Language: en-gb,en-us
  >Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8
  >Connection: keep-alive
  >Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  >Content-Length: 37
  >
  >fullname=Samhar+Mahmoud&eyecolour=Brown
  >```

  - The **METHOD attribute** of a `<form>` element specifies the HTTP method for submission: **GET** or **POST**
  - **GET** - the form data is added to the end of the action URL **with a ?**. 
    - The web server passes the form data to the application as parameters. 
  - **POST** - the URL is that given in the form's ACTION attribute, **with no ? extension**
    - The form data, encoded in the same way as for **GET**, becomes the HTTP message's entity body. 

- Comperation

  - **GET**
    - Should be used for **safe and idempotent** processing
    - Can be faster as less data exchanged
  - **POST**
    -  Better for **large data** and security

#### 26. Introduction to XML

###### ***Theorem 26.1.*** XML Overview

- XML vs. HTML
  - XML 
    - Was designed to carry data with focus on <u>what data is</u>. 
    - Tags are not predefined. 
  - HTML
    - Was designed to display data with focus on <u>how data looks</u>. 
    - Tags are predefined. 
- XML technologies by *W3C*
  - XML Essential
    - XML is shouldered by a set of essential technologies (e.g. infoset, namespaces, ...)
    - They address issues when using XML in specific applications contexts.
  - ...
  - Schema
    - Formal descriptions of vocabularies create flexibility in authoring environments and quality control chains. 
    - W3C’s XML Schema, SML, and data binding technologies provide the tools for quality control of XML data.
  - ...

###### ***Theorem 26.2.*** XML Essential

- Tags

  > e.g. 
  >
  > ```xml
  > <title>War and Peace</title>
  > ```

  - To mark up data in XML you precede it with an **opening tag** and follow it with a **closing tag**. 

    An opening tag has the form `<NAME>`, where `NAME` is the name of the tag, follows with a closing tag `</NAME>`. 

  - Tags are **Case Sensitive**. 

- Elements - A part of a document surrounded in opening/closing tags

  >e.g.
  >
  >```xml
  ><chapter>
  >  <title>Introduction</title>
  >  This is what I'm going to say...
  ></chapter>
  ><chapter>
  >  <title>Conclusions</title>
  >  This is what I've said
  ></chapter>
  >```

  - Can be nested in a **hierarchy**, where each tag is understood partly by the other tags which surround it. 

- Attributes - Can be used to parameterise elements

  >e.g.
  >
  >```xml
  ><book columns = “two-column” 
  >      author = “Leo Tolstoy”>
  >			... 
  ></book>
  >```

  - Consists of a name and a value in ‘single quotes’ or “double quotes”. 
  - Attributes contain data related to a specific element. 
  - Put inside element's opening tag after name
  - Some special attributes: 
    - **xmlns** - Namespace declaration
    - **xml:lang** - The language in which the text is written

- Documents - contains a single element, the **root** of the hierarchy, enclosing all the other elements

  - Preceding the root element should be a **prolog** consisting of two special tags: 

    1. XML declaration - A special tag `<?xml..?>` that is put before the root to specify the form of XML with attributes

       > e.g.
       >
       > ```xml
       > <?xml version = “1.0” encoding = “UTF-16” standalone = “yes”?>
       > ```

       - **Version** - The version of XML used
       - **Encoding** - The character set used
       - **Standalone** - Whether the document be parsed on its own, or needs other documents to be parsed fi

    2. Document Type Declaration (optional) - used to specify the **schema** followed by the XML document

- Entities - Particular characters to delimit the elements and attributes (i.e., Represent special strings)

  > e.g.
  >
  > Transmitted XML
  >
  > ```xml
  > <book>
  >   <title>War &amp; Peace</title>
  >   Peace &gt; War
  > </book>
  > ```
  >
  > Parsed text
  > ```
  > War & Peace
  > Peace > War
  > ```

  - Entities cannot be used inside the marked-up text itself. 

  - When the XML is parsed, the entities are replaced by the character they represent

    ```xml
    &quot;	<!-- " -->
    &apos;	<!-- ' -->
    &amp;		<!-- & -->
    &lt;		<!-- < -->
    &gt;		<!-- > -->
    ```

- Comments - Used to help those looking at the XML directly (as with source code comments)

  - Written in the form: `<!-- Comment -->`
  - May appear anywhere in document after the XML declaration.

###### ***Theorem 26.3.*** XML Namespaces

>Each XML-based application understands particular tags/
>
>With XML being exchanged between hosts and between applications, it is important to distinguish tags with different meanings or uses in different contexts, so we need Namespaces. 

- **Namespaces** - Are used to allow software to know how to interpret tags

  - A single tag name may be used for different purposes and have **different meanings**
  - A namespace is identified by a URI, and every element and attribute name has a namespace

- Namespace declarations

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```xml
  > <!-- Example for defualt namespaces -->
  > <!-- Namespace for chapter & section: http://book.namespace -->
  > <!-- Namespace for picture: http://pictures -->
  > <chapter xmlns = “http://book.namespace”>
  >   <section>
  >     <picture xmlns = “http://pictures”/>
  >   </section>
  > </chapter>
  > 
  > <!-- Example for namespace prefixes -->
  > <book:chapter
  > 	xmlns:book = “http://book.namespace”
  >   xmlns:person = “http://per.namespace”
  >   person:author = “Samhar Mahmoud”>
  >   	<book:section>...</book:section>
  > </book:chapter>
  > 
  > <!-- Example for mixed declarations -->
  > <!-- Namespace for outer: http://one -->
  > <!-- Namespace for inner: http://two -->
  > <outer xmlns = “http://one”>
  > 	<middle xmlns:t = “http://two”>
  >   	<t:inner> some text </t:inner>
  > 	</middle>
  > </outer>
  > ```
  >
  > 

  - Two ways to give the namespace of an element or attribute: 
    1. **Default** namespaces - Give a namespace to every element in a hierarchy except where overridden. 
    2. Namespace **prefixes** - Identifiers added to an element/attribute name to give its namespace
  - Default namespaces
    - Using **xmlns = “NS-URI”** attribute in an element 
    - Specifies that the element and all element within it will by default use namespace NS-URI
  - Namespace prefixes
    - Using the attribute **xmlns:PREFIX = “NS-URI”**
    - PREFIX is a code preceding each name that has namespace NS-URI

###### ***Theorem 26.4.*** XML Validation

- XML Validation - A language for expressing **constraints** about XML documents

  - There are **several different schema languages** in use, but the main ones are:

    Document Type Definitions (DTDs), Relax-NG, Schematron and W3C XSD (XML Schema Definitions).

- XML Schema - describes the **structure of an XML** document

  >e.g.
  >
  >```xml
  ><!-- In XML Schema, in order to assert an element has a given type, -->
  ><!-- the following structure is used: -->
  >
  ><!-- Schema format -->
  ><element name=”ELEM-NAME” type=“TYPE”/>
  >
  ><!-- Schema example -->
  ><xs:element  name = ”numberOfPages” type = “xs:integer”/>
  >
  ><!-- XML conforming to schema -->
  ><numberOfPages>25</numberOfPages>
  >```

  - An XML document with correct syntax is called **Well Formed**, 

    While an XML document validated against an XML Schema is both **Well Formed** and **Valid**, 

  - XML schema documents are, themselves, written in XML, 

  - An XML Schema document is often referred to as an **XSD (XML Schema Definition)** and given the file extension `.xsd`

  - XML Schema 1.0 documents use the namespace: `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema`
