### 6.1. Introduction to Consensus Mechanism

##### 6.1.1. Consensus Mechanism

- Definition
  - A mechanism widely used to update the state among different nodes in a decentralized system.

- Context
  - Applies to multi-agent systems where agents are interconnected, forming a graph: 
    - Agents are programed with the same program.
    - With agents as nodes, and the connections between them as edges
    - We use the terms *agent* and *node* interchangeably.
  - Assume the agents share a common goal to achieve an overall configuration of states. 
- Properties
  - Each agent can take a finite number of states. 
  - Interactions proceed in a series of rounds. 
    - Each round, each agent has to decide what state to be in. 
    - Agents make their decision according to an algorithm.
    - All agents are using the same algorithm. 
    - The algorithm may first check the colours of the neighbours in the previous round.

##### 6.1.2. Application

- Robot bucket brigades. 
- Consensus in *distributed systems*. 
- Designing and managing swarms.

    - Nodes represent *agents*. 
    - Shape of nodes represent their their current opinion. This may change over time. 
    - Edges represent what other agents a node sees. 
  
  - The goal is to reach consensus. i.e., All agents with same shape. 
  
  - They can learn from their *neighbours* over time. 
  
- Definition
  
  - A method to solve with the presenting problem.
  
  - The process happens in **rounds**, or **time-steps**, denoted by $t$.
  
  - At each round $t$, each agent $v$ selects one of its neighbours $u$ uniformly at random.
  
  - Then, $v$ adopts $u$'s colours for next round.
  
    > To avoid ambiguity, we consider that they all change **at the same time** at the end of round $t$.
  
- Notation

  - Assume there is a time variable $t \in T$ that represent rounds. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > In our case, $T$ is the set of non-negative integers 0, 1, ...

  - We have an undirected connected graph $G = (V, E)$.

    - An edge $(v, u)$  indicates that $v$ sees $u$ and $u$ sees $v$.

    - The number of neighbours of $v$ is denoted by $deg(v)$.

    - A set of colours or opinions $X$.

      > e.g.
      >
      > In our case, $X = \{b, r\}$

    - For each time $t \in T$, the current state of the process is described by a function $S_t :V \to X$.

    - For a given $t$, we have $S_t(v) = b$ for all $v \in V$, we say $S_t = \text{blue}$. Analogously for red, we have $S_t = \text{red}$.

      > e.g.
      >
      > In these cases, we say the processes ends, and we denote this by saying that $S_{end} = \text{blue}, or S_{end} = \text{red}$. 


##### 6.2.2. Probabilities of Consensus

- Definition

  - The <u>sum of degrees of nodes</u> with a given colour count for an opinion's advantage. 

- Calculation

  - Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph that do not allow deadlocks in a voter model process. 

    > i.e., a consensus is reached with probability 1. 

  - Given an initial configuration $S_0 = s$, the probability of blue winning is given by 
    $$
    \Pr (S_{end} = \text{blue} | S_0 = s) = \sum_{v \in V, s(v) \in b} \frac{deg(v)}{2 |E|}
    $$

- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```mermaid
  > graph LR
  > 	v1(v1) --- v2(v2)
  > 	v1 --- v3
  > 	v2 --- v3
  > 	v3 --- v4
  > 	v2 --- v4
  > 	v3 --- v5
  > 	v4 --- v5 
  > ```
  >
  > As $t = 0$, then
  >
  > $\Pr(S_{end} = \text{blue} | S_0 = s) =\frac{4 + 3 + 2}{14} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 64\%$
  >
  > $\Pr(S_{end} = \text{red} | S_0 = s) =\frac{2 + 3}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 36\%$

### 6.3. Block Chains

##### 6.3.1. Introduction to Block Chains

- Bitcoin (BTC)
  - Bitcoin was conceived in 2008, and was deployed in 2009. This is the world’s first decentralized electronic currency. 
  - Key problem of an electronic currency:
    - Ensure there is no double-spending of currency
    - *Prior solution*: Have a central node in charge of allocation
    - *Weakness*: Central node may be corrupt or vulnerable to attack
  - Solutions by BTC
    - Have the allocations of currency witnessed and approved by all nodes in the network.
    - And chaining of data makes it impossible to change past data surreptitiously.
- Block Chain
  - The underlying technology of BTC was called Blockchain. 
  - There was no new invention, just a clever combination of previous CS technologies:
    - Peer-to-peer (P2P) network
    - Consensus Protocol for automated collective decision-making
    - Proof-of-Work to enable appropriate economic incentives
    - Cryptography for authentication of participants (PKI – Public Key Infrastructure)
  - Basic atoms
    - **Transactions (TXs**) shifting allocation of some currency from one node to another node.
    - Transactions grouped into blocks, then blocks chained together. There will be a new block about every 10 minutes. 
  - Now part of **Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)**.
- Economic incentives
  - The designers of the system want to incentivize participation. Processing transactions takes some work. So the system rewards uploading blocks. 
  - But the network is open and pseudonymous. So the network needs to discourage this
- Block Chain and Consensus
  - The Bitcoin Blockchain uses a *consensus protocol* for all nodes in the network to agree on addition of each new block to the existing blockchain.
  - The decisions are made independently and automatically by each node, each one using the exact same algorithm.
  - The decision by each node is made on basis of information received from their neighbours (new TXs and new blocks).
  - To maintain the false block in the chain over an extended period, the malicious node needs to keep mining new blocks on top of the false block.
  


##### 6.3.2. Decentralized consensus

- Components

  1. **Independent verification** of each transaction, by every full node. 

  2. **Independent aggregation** of those transactions into new blocks by mining nodes.

     > Together with demonstrated computation through a Proof-of-Work algorithm. 

  3. **Independent verification** of the new blocks by every node and assembly into a chain. 

  4. **Independent** selection, by every node, of the chain with the most cumulative computation demonstrated through Proof-of-Work.

- The high-level process

  - Within a P2P network
  
    > Currently about 11300 nodes. 
    >
    > No one is in charge. 
    >
    > All full nodes have the same software. 
  
  - A node issues a potential transaction (TX), which is sent to all nodes in its neighbourhood (those it knows about). 
  
  - Each receiving node checks the potential TX for syntax and validity. 
  
    - If validated, the receiving node sends the TX to all its neighbours, and so on. 
  
  - Full nodes try to assemble a new block. They concatenate new TXs together. 
  
  - Full nodes also try to solve the math puzzle (by doing work) and sending the candidate block to their neighbours. 
  
  - Each receiving node validates the candidate block and adds it to its copy of the existing chain, then sends to its neighbours. 
  
    - *The Longest-Chain-Rule*: When faced with competing blocks on the chain, decides to accept the chain with the greatest cumulative proof of work. This is the decision to adopt a particular state (or colour).
  
- Resolving differences

  - Motivation
    - Because of network delays, the longest chain in one part of the network may <u>be different to that in another part of the network</u>.
  - Process
    - Faced with competing blocks, each node adds the different blocks to the existing chain, and then chooses the chain with the greatest cumulative work.
      - If the result is a tie: the node waits until another valid block is received.
      - If the result is again a tie: the process continues until a clear answer emerges.
    - Most often, the conflict (called a temporary fork) is resolved within 2 or 3 blocks (i.e., 20-30 minutes). 

- Evaluation

  - The system works well if all nodes are acting correctly and in good faith.
  - The system does not work well if nodes have bugs or are acting maliciously. But this should be only temporary. 
    - If a malicious node has inserted a false block this will eventually be superseded by other valid blocks.
