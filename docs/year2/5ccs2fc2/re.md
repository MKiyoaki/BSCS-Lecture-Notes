>Exam Information:
>
>- 2 hours
>- 10-11 questions
>  - MCQ and typing questions
>

#### 1. Calculation

- WEEK I

  - Regular language

- WEEK IV

  - SCC and topological sorting
  - Find MST by Prim or Kruskal Algorithm

- WEEK V
  - Master Theorem

- WEEK VI

  - 2-OPT Algorithm

    > Steps
    >
    > 1. Find the MST
    > 2. Preorder the MST
    > 3. Take 2 edge and swap the connection
    > 4. Until there is no possible improvement

- WEEK V

  - N SAT reduction

    > e.g.
    >
    > 3 SAT to 2 SAT
    >
    > 1. Convert formula to implications
    > 2. Make list of all literals

- WEEK VII
  - Simplex Method

#### 2. Proof

>May give a template in proof

- WEEK II

  - Something is NP

    >e.g.
    >
    >- CLIQUE is NP, HAMILTONIAN is NP
    >
    >- New problem that belongs to NP
    >
    > >Steps:
    > >
    > >1. Cannot be solved in polynomial time
    > >
    > >   (for SAT like, take all solutions; for HAMILTONIAN like, take all orderring results. And there are expontential solutions at last)
    > >2. Can construct deterministic turing machine and run it in parallel in polynomial time
    > >
    > >Explain the reasons for cannot be or can be run in polynomial time is important

  - Something is P (i.e., can be solved in polynomial time)

  - Someting is NP-hard - Lower Bound questions

    >Generally by transitive and reduction the problem to SAT/CLIQUE/HAMILTONIAN

  - SAT$\leq_p$CLIQUE or SAT$\leq_p$HAMILTONIAN

- WEEK III

  - Cook-Levin Theorem for some specific result

- WEEK IX

  - The Halting Problem - Prove something is undecidable by *contradiction*
  
    > Can swap to Accept or Reject Problem
  - 


#### 3. Some Definitions

- WEEK I
  - Language - Note that empty set is the subset of every set
- WEEK II
  - Satisfiable
- WEEK VI
  - R-Approxiable and Unapproxiable
- WEEK IX
  - Decidable and Undecidable
