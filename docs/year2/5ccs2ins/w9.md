#### 30. RDF (Resource Description Framework)

***Theorem 30.1.*** Resource Description Framework

- Definition

  - `Resource Description Framework (RDF)` - Several technologies are required to make the semantic web works

    - A **data structure** in which to make computer-readable statements
    - An RDF document is a set of statements

  - `Statement` - asserts something about a resource, sometimes its relation to another resource, consists of three parts:

    - The **subject** of the statement: what resource the statement is about, e.g. https://transtechsocial.org/news
    - The **object** of the statement: what resource or value the subject is related to, e.g. Angelica Ross
    - The **predicate** of the statement: how the subject and object are related, e.g. contributor

    > We can write an RDF statement in such format: 
    >
    > `subject` `predicate` `object`. 

  - `Resource` - The **subjects** of RDF statements, or sometimes the **objects**

    - Identifiable by a URI

      > e.g.
      >
      > - A webpage or other web-accessible document or service
      > - A physical thing, such as a person, organisation or book
      > - An abstract concept, e.g. being happy or the number pi

    - URIs are also used to give unique identifiers for the predicates of RDF statements, e.g. creator

    - Write an URI in a statement between <...> brackets

      > e.g.
      >
      > `<https://transtechsocial.org/news>`
      >
      > `<https://missross.com/>`

  - `Vocabularies` - A set of terms defined together to allow descriptions in some particular domain, similar to namespaces

    - Each term is a URI, and all the URIs in a vocabulary start with the same string

      > e.g.
      >
      > The vocabulary `http://purl.org/dc/terms/` describes who created and published resources, at what times, and similar library data, including terms such as:
      >
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator` – relates a resource to its creator
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher` – relates a resource to its publisher
      > - `http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor` - relates a resource to an entity responsible for making contributions to it

  - `Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)`

  - `Values`
  
- Semantic web pages
