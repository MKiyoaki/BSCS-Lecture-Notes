### 15. Introdution to Types

##### 15.1. Typing

- Definition

  - Values are divided into classes, called **types**, and each type is associated with a set of operations.
    - Types help to ensure that a program behaves in a precise, pre-determined way.
    - Types may be given explicitly by the programmer or inferred automatically by the type system.

    > The following bit of code illustrates how types are explicitly given in a typical C++ program
    >
    > ```c++
    > void wait (string message) {
    > 	cout << message << endl;
    > 	cout << "Press ENTER to continue..." << flush; cin.ignore (100, '\n');
    > }
    > ```

- Static vs. Dynamic Typing

  - Introduction
    - Checking that types are being used in the correct way is sometimes referred to as *typing*.
    - Typing may be checked before execution (static typing) or during execution (dynamic typing). 
      > e.g.
      >
      > Statically typed languages - C, C++, Java, Haskell, etc. 
      >
      > Dynamically typed languages - Python, JavaScript, PHP, etc. 
  - Static Typing
    - Every valid expression must have a type. Expressions that cannot be "typed" are considered erroneous and are rejected by the compiler without evaluation.
    - A program that passes the type controls is not guaranteed to be correct, but it is free of type errors at runtime. 
    - Pros
      - Types help detecting errors at an early stage.
      - Types help in the design of software since they are a simple form of specification.
    - Types in Haskell
      - Basic data types: Booleans, characters, numbers. 
        > e.g.
        >
        > `Bool`, `Char`, `Int`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`
      - Constructed types: tuples, lists, strings.
        >e.g.
        >
        >`[Integer]` is the type of lists of (arbitrary precision) integers, `(Int, Bool)` is a pair (binary tuple) of an integer and a Boolean. 
      - Function types.
        > e.g.
        >
        > `Char -> Bool`, `(Int -> Int) -> Int`
        >
        > > Note that the arrow type constructor associates to the right. 
      - The programmer can also define new types.

##### 15.2. Polymorphism

- Definition

  - Type systems can be
    - **monomorphic** where every expression has at most one type, or
    - **polymorphic** where some expressions have more than one type.
    > e.g.
    >
    > Functional composition
    >
    > ```haskell
    > (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
    > ```
    >
    > where a, b and c are *type variables.*

- Polymorphic Types

  - Formally, the language of polymorphic types is defined as a set of *terms* built out of 
    - *type variables* (`a`, `b`, `c`, ... ), and 
    - *type constructors* 
      - which are either atomic (`Integer`, `Float`, ...),
      -  or take arguments (*e.g. `T1→T2, [T]`*).
      > e.g.
      >
      > ```haskell
      > V ::= a,b,c...
      > C ::= Int,Bool,Char,->,[],()... 
      > T ::= V|C(T1,T2,...Tn)
      > ```
  - A **polymorphic type** represents the set of its *instances*, obtained by substituting type variables by types.

- Type Variables

  - Type variables already exist in languages such as C++ to specify polymorphic types.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```c++
    > template <typename A, typename B>
    > 	pair<B,A> flip_pair (const pair<A,B> &p) {
    >   	return pair<B,A> (p.second, p.first);
    > }; 
    > 
    > ```

  - Examples of polymorphism in Haskell

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > square :: Integer -> Integer
    > sqrt :: Integer -> Float
    > 
    > -- from square and sqrt, we can infer that quad is a type of Integer -> Integer
    > quad = square * square 
    > 
    > -- using the signature of the folloiwng expression
    > (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c): 
    > (*) :: (Integer -> Integer) -> (Integer -> Integer) -> (Integer -> Integer)
    > 
    > -- but sqrt * square is a type of Integer -> Integer
    > (*)::(Integer -> Float) -> (Integer -> Integer) -> (Integer -> Float)
    > 
    > ```
    >

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > error :: String -> a
    > fact :: Integer -> Integer
    > fact n
    > 		| n > 0 = n * (fact (n - 1)) | n == 0 = 1
    > 		| n < 0 = error "negative argument"
    > ```
    >
    > Here the function `error` is used with type `String → Integer`

- Overloading

  - Definition
    - **Overloading** is a related notion (also called *ad-hoc polymorphism*) where several functions, with different types, share the same name.
  - Haskell Approach
    - We may want to specify a general operation such as addition for both integers or reals. However, a polymorphic type such as, `(+) :: a → a → a` is too general. Because it would allow addition to be used with *any* type. 
    - There are several solutions to this problem.
      - Some languages use different symbols/names for operations on specific types. 
        > e.g.
        >
        > `+` and `+.` in Caml
        >
        > `div 2 3` and `2 / 3` in Haskell
      
      - Enrich the language of types
      
        > e.g.
        >
        > `(+) :: (Integer -> Integer -> Integer) ∧ (Float -> Float -> Float)`

      - Define the notion of a *type class* 
      
        > e.g.
        >
        > In Haskell, `(+):: Num a => a -> a -> a`, that is, `(+)` has type `a -> a -> a` where `a` is in the class `Num`. 

##### 15.3. Type Inference

- Definition

  - Most modern functional languages do NOT require that the programmer provides the type for the expressions used. The compiler is able to *infer* a type, if one exists. 
    - The type of a complex expression is inferred using with that, 
      - the <u>operations</u> used in the expression, and 
      - the <u>type of its atomic constituents</u>, assigning the most general type possible.
    - The way that the different components are put together to form the expression indicates the <u>constraints that the type variables must satisfy</u>.
    - If the constraints cannot be solved, the inference **fails** and the expression is deemed untypeable.

- The *type* of an expression <u>only depends on its components</u>.

  > e.g.
  >
  > Consider the definition `square x = x * x`, what is the type of the function `square`? 
  >
  > > 1. It's a function, so the most general type is `a -> b`. 
  > > 2. Using `square`'s definition, `x :: a` and `x * x :: b`. 
  > > 3. We know that `(*) :: Int -> Int -> Int` is a primitive function.
  > > 4. Therefore, if `x :: Int`, then `x * x :: Int`, and then both `a` and `b` must be of type `Int`.
  > > 5. Therefore, `square :: Int -> Int`. 

  >e.g.
  >
  >Can we find more general type of `square x = x * x`? 
  >
  >>- We know the most general type of `(*)` is `Num => c -> c -> c -> c`, so we also know that if `x :: Num c => c`, then `x * x :: Num c => c`. 
  >>- We now have the constraints `a = (Num c => c)` and `b = (Num c => c)` on the domain and co-domain of square, respectively, which we can solve by instanting `a` with `Num c => c` and `b` with `Num c => c`. 
  >>- Therefore, `square :: Num c => c -> c`. 
  >>

  >e.g.
  >
  >Given that `square :: Int -> Int`, what is the type of the expression `square square 3`?
  >
  >>- Remember that application associates to the left, so the expression reads `(square square) 3`. 
  >>- So the first `square` expects an argument of type `Int`, but it is given an argument of type `(Int -> Int)` and the expression cannot be typed.
  >>- This is because the constraint `Int = (Int -> Int)` cannot be solved.

### 16. Lists and User-defined Types

##### 16.1. Lists

- Definition

  > e.g.
  >
  > ``` haskell
  > [] :: [a]
  > 
  > (1 : 2 : []) :: [Int]
  > -- or 
  > [1, 2] :: [Int]
  > 
  > ['c', 'a', 't'] :: [Char]
  > [3.0, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415] :: [Double]
  > [[True, False], [True]] :: [[Bool]]
  > 
  > -- Notice that strings are simply lists of characters. 
  > -- The following expressions evaluate to True
  > "cat" == ['c','a','t']
  > "cat" == 'c':['a','t']
  > ```

  - *Linked lists* are an important primitive data type in most functional languages.
    - `[] :: [a]` - the empty list
    - `(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]` - add an element to a list ("cons")
    - `head :: [a] -> a` - return the first element of a non-empty list
    - `tail :: [a] -> a` - return the remainder of a non-empty list

  - Lists are so common they have their own special syntax
    > e.g., `(1 : 2 : 3 : [])` would be abbreviated to `[1, 2, 3]`.

- Functions on Lists

  - Functions on lists and other constructed types are usually defined using pattern matching.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > size :: [a] -> Int
    > size [] = 0
    > size (x : xs) = 1 + size xs
    > 
    > -- samples
    > size [] -> 0 
    > size[1, 6, 1, 8, 0] -> 1 + size[6, 1, 8, 0] ->*  5
    > 
    > ```
    
    > e.g.
    >
    > Write the definition for a function `elem' x l` that checks whether an element `x` exists in a list `l`.
    >
    > >```haskell
    > >elem' :: [a] -> a -> Bool
    > >elem' [] a = False
    > >elem' (x : xs) a = if a == x then True else elem' xs a
    > >
    > >```

##### 16.2. User-defined Types

- Definition

  - We can define our own new types by <u>declaring the *data* and *type* constructors of that type</u>.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
    > ```
    >
    > Here, `Nat` is a new type and, `Zero` and `Succ` are its *data constructors*. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > data Seq a = Empty | Cons a (Seq a)
    > ```
    >
    > Here `Seq` a is a new polymorphic, recursive type, whose elements are built using one of the data constructors `Empty` or `Cons`.
    >
    >  `Seq` is a type constructor.

  - Type constructors define new polymorphic types.

- Data constructors

  - Data constructors are used to <u>build terms of a type</u>.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > Zero :: Nat
    > (Succ (Succ Zero)) :: Nat
    > Empty :: Seq a
    > (Cons (Succ Zero) Empty) :: Seq Nat
    > 
    > ```

  - Data constructors can be used when giving definitions by **pattern matching**.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > isempty Empty = True
    > isempty (Cons x y) = False
    > 
    > ```

    > e.g.
    >
    > Write the definition for a data type `Tree` a representing binary trees with data stored in the leaves. Use data constructors `Leaf` and `Branch`.
    >
    > >```haskell
    > >-- Declare the data type Tree
    > >data Tree = Leaf | Branch (Tree a) (Tree b)
    > >
    > >-- Declare a method height for the tree
    > >height :: Tree a -> Int
    > >height (Leaf _) = 1
    > >height (Branch 1 r) = 1 + max (height 1) (height r) where max x y = if x > y then x else y
    > >
    > >-- samples
    > >height (Branch (Leaf 1) (Branch (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3))) ->* 3
    > >```


##### 16.3. Structural Induction

- Reason with Recursive Types

  - Use the *Principle of Structural Induction*.

    > e.g.
    >
    > In the case of `Nat`, to prove a property $P$ for all elements of `Nat` we have to
    >
    > 1. Prove $P(\text{Zero})$ - the *base case* of the induction. 
    > 2. Prove that if $P(n)$ holds - the inductive hypothesis, then $P(\text{Succ } n)$ holds. 

    > This is the familiar *Principle of Mathematical Induction*
    >
    > $(P(0) \wedge \forall n\ (P(n) \implies P(n+1))) \iff \forall n\ P(n)$

- Example

  >e.g.
  >
  >```haskell
  >-- Define Addition on Nat by pattern Matching
  >add Zero x = x
  >add (Succ x) y = Succ (add x y)
  >
  >-- Prove by induction that add n Zero = n
  >add Zero Zero = Zero -- Base case
  >add (Succ n) Zero = Succ(add n Zero) -- Inductive case, i.e., add is equal to Succ n
  >
  >-- Prove by indcution that sumNat n = n * (n + 1) / 2
  >sumNat x
  >		| x == 0 = 0
  >		| x > 0 = x + sumNat (x - 1)
  >		| otherwise = error "Negative argument! "
  >
  >```

### 17. Introduction to Functional Semantics

##### 17.1. Introduction

- Define functional programs using *transition systems*

  > The language that we consider is a small, first-order, functional programming language working on integers and Booleans, called *SFUN*. 
  >
  > We will define the syntax of SFUN, then give its semantics using the structural operational semantics approach.

  - We can classify functional languages according to the evaluation strategy they implement.
    - Call-by-value
    - Call-by-name

- Syntax of SFUN

  - Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a set of variables $\{x, y, z,...\}$ and let F be a set of function names $\{f_1, f_2,..., f_i,...\}$, each with a fixed arity $⟨f_i⟩$.
    The *terms* of the language SFUN are defined by the grammar
    ```
    op ::= + | - | * | /
    bop ::= > | < | >= | <=
    t ::= n | b | x | t1 op t2 | t1 bop t2 | ¬t1 | t1 ∧ t2
    |if t0 then t1 else t2 | f(t1,...,t⟨f⟩)
    ```
    where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b \in \{\text{True, False}\}$

- Variables

  - The notation $\text{vars}(t)$ is used to denote <u>the variables that occur in the term $t$</u>. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > $\text{vars}(x) = \{x\}$
    >
    > $\text{vars}(f(x, y)) = \{y, z\}$​

  - A **closed term** is a term such that $\text{vars}(t) = ∅$​, that is a term that contains no variables. 

- Programs

  - A program in SFUN is a set of recursive equations, 
    $$
    \begin{matrix} 
    f_1(x_1, ..., x_{⟨f_1⟩}) &= &d_1 \\
     &... \\
    f_k(x_k, ..., x_{⟨f_k⟩}) &= &d_k \\
    \end{matrix}
    $$
    such that
    - $d_1, ..., d_k$ are terms,
    - $\text{vars}(d_i) ⊆ \{x_1,...,x_{⟨f_i⟩}\}, ∀i.1 \leq i \leq k$, 
    - there is only one equation for each function name $f_i$​
  - Equations may be recursive, thus the term $d_i$ may contain occurrences of $f_1, ..., f_k$. 

  > e.g. 
  >
  > ```SFUN
  > may(x, y) = if x >= y then x else y
  > fact(x) = if x <= 0 then 1 else x * fact(x - 1)
  > 
  > square(x) = x * x
  > quadratic(x, a, b, c) = a * square(x) + b * x + c
  > 
  > mod(x) = if x - y < 0 then x else mod(x - y, y)
  > even(x) = mod(x, 2) = 0
  > collatz(x) = if x = 1 then 1 else if even(x) then x/2 else 3 * x + 1	
  > ```

##### 17.2. Operational Semantics

- Semantics of SFUN

  - We will give the semantics of SFUN in the *structural operational semantics style*. Assume that programs are well-typed.
    - Define the *evaluation relation* (a big-step semantics) for terms in the context of the program $P$, by <u>using a *transition system* where *configurations* are just terms</u>. 
    - Values of the system are integer and Boolean values. 
    - The evaluation relation relates closed SFUN terms to values in the context of $P$, and is denoted by $⇓_P$. 
    - The evaluation strategy that we will model first is a *call-by-value* strategy. 

- Call-by-value evaluation of SFUN

  - The evaluation relation $⇓_P$ is defined inductively as follows, 
    $$
    \begin{matrix}
    \frac{}{n ⇓_P n} &\text{(n)} \\
    \frac{}{b ⇓_P b} &\text{(b)} \\
    
    \frac{t_1 ⇓_P n_1 \ t_2 ⇓_P n_2}{t_1 \text{ op } t_2 ⇓_P n} &\text{(op)} &\text{if } n_1 \text{ op } n_2 = n \\
    \frac{t_1 ⇓_P n_1 \ t_2 ⇓_P n_2}{t_1 \text{ bop } t_2 ⇓_P b} &\text{(bop)} &\text{if } n_1 \text{ bop } n_2 = n \\
    
    \frac{t_1 ⇓_P b_1 \ t_2 ⇓_P b_2}{t_1 \wedge t_2 ⇓_P n} &\text{(and)} &\text{if } n_1 \wedge n_2 = n \\
    \frac{t ⇓_P b_1}{\neg t ⇓_P b} &\text{(not)} &\text{if } b = \neg b_1  \\
    
    \frac{ t_0⇓_P \text{ True }\ t_1 ⇓_P v_ 1}{\text{if } t_0 \text{ then } t_1 \text{ else } t_2 ⇓_P v_1} &(\text{if}_t) \\
    
    \frac{ t_0⇓_P \text{ False }\ t_2 ⇓_P v_ 2}{\text{if } t_0 \text{ then } t_1 \text{ else } t_2 ⇓_P v_2} &(\text{if}_f) \\
    
    \frac{t_1 ⇓_P v_1\ ...\ t_{⟨f_i⟩} ⇓_P v_{⟨f_i⟩} \ d_i\{x_1 \mapsto v_1, ..., x_{⟨f_i⟩} \mapsto v_{⟨f_i⟩}⇓_P v\}}{f_i(t_1, ..., t_{⟨f_i⟩})} &(\text{fn}_\text{val})
    
    \end{matrix}
    $$
    
  > e.g.
  >
  > Let $P$ be the program
  >
  > ```SFUN
  > infinity = infinity + 1
  > fortytwo(x) = 42
  > square(x) = x * x
  > 
  > ```
  >
  > The term `fortytwo(0)` has the value 42, that is, `fortytwo(0)` $⇓_P 42$.
  >
  > Proof.
  >
  > $\frac{\frac{\ }{0 ⇓_P 0}(\text{n}) \ \frac{\ }{42\{x \mapsto 0\} ⇓_P 42}(\text{n})}{\text{fortytwo}(0)⇓_P42}(\text{fn}_\text{val})$​
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > The term `fortytwo(infinity)` does not have a value, because the evaluation of the argument `infinity` gives no value. ot have a value `infinity` cannot be constructed because it recurses infinitely on the rule $(\text{fn}_\text{val})$. 
  >
  > The term $\text{square}(2 + 1)$ has the value 9, thus $\text{square}(2 + 1) ⇓_P 9$​.
  >
  > Proof.
  >
  > $\frac{\frac{\frac{}{2⇓_P 2} \text{(n)} \ \frac{}{1⇓_P 1} \text{(n)}}{2+1⇓_P 3} (\text{op}) \frac{\frac{}{1⇓_P 1} \text{(n)} \ \frac{}{1⇓_P 1} \text{(n)}}{(x * x \{x \mapsto 3\}⇓_P 9)} (\text{op})}{\text{square}(2+1)⇓_P 9} (\text{fn}_\text{val})$

##### 17.3. Unicity of Normal Forms

- Determinism

  - The evaluation strategy defined by the axioms and rules is **deterministic**, that is, 
    For any closed term $t$, $t ⇓_P v_1 \text{ and } t ⇓_P v_2 \implies v_1 = v_2 $​. 

    > Proof. 
    >
    > By rule induction. 

  - Details of proof of determinsim
    - We distinguish cases according to the rule that applies to $t$​. For any term, there is only one rule that can be applied.
      - Base Case:
        - If $t$ is an integer $n$ then $n ⇓_P n$ using the $\text{axiom}(n)$. 
        - If $t$ is a Boolean $b$ then $b ⇓_P b$ using the $\text{axiom}(n)$. 
    
          > Therefore there is only one value in both cases.
          >
          > There are no more base cases, because $t$ is closed and thus cannot contain variables.
    
      - Inductive Cases:
        - Assume $t$ is the term $f(t_1, ..., t_{⟨f⟩})$. 
        - Then using the rule $(\text{fn}_\text{val})$, such that $f_i(t_1, ..., t_{⟨f⟩}) ⇓_P v$ if and only if $t_1 ⇓_P v_1, ..., t_{⟨f_i⟩} ⇓_P v_{⟨f_i⟩}$, and $d_i \{x_1 \mapsto v_1, ..., x_{⟨f_i⟩} ⇓_P v_{⟨f_i⟩}\}$. 
        - Therefore $v$ is uniquely determined. 
    
          > The cases corresponding to the other rules are samilar.

### 18. Call by Name Evaluation and Typing

##### 18.1. Call-by-name evaluation

- Motivation

  - Recalling the Call-by-value rule $(\text{fn}_\text{val})$ *(see 12.2. )*. For this rule, it requires that the arguments given to the function are evaluated before the funciton is applied. 
  - Consider the functions in the program $P$, 
    ```SFUN
    infinity = infinity + 1
    fortytwo(x) = 42
    square(x) = x * x
    
    ```
    The use of $\text{fn}_\text{val}$ can become problematic or inefficient  in the evaluation of terms such as `fortytwo(infinity)` or `fortytwo(2^3542)`. 

- Call-by-name evaluation of SFUN

  - In order to model the call-by-name strategy we need to change the rule that defines the behaviour of application.
  - We *replace it* with the following rule, 
    $$
    \frac{d_i\{x_1 \mapsto t_1, ..., x_{⟨f_i⟩} \mapsto t_{⟨f_i⟩}\}}{f_i(t_1, ..., t_{⟨f_i⟩})⇓_P v} \ (\text{fn}_\text{name})
    $$
  - The system remains **determinisitc**. 

  > e.g.
  >
  > Using the call-by-name semantics, the term `fortytwo(0)` also has the value 42, `fortytwo(0)`$⇓_P 42$. 
  >
  > However in contrast to call-by-value, `fortytwo(infinity)` $⇓_P 42$, because the argument `infinity` is discarded without being evaluated. 
  >
  > $\frac{\frac{}{42\{x \mapsto \text{infinity}\} ⇓_P 42 } (n)}{\text{fortytwo(infinity)} ⇓_P 42 } (\text{fn}_\text{name})$

##### 18.2. Types

- Types for SFUN

  - The grammar defining the syntax of SFUN allows us to build terms such as $1 + True$​ which do not make sense. So in the definition of the semantics of SFUN <u>we only considered *well-typed* terms</u>.
  - *Base* terms
    - The *base* terms $\beta, \tau$​ of SFUN are defined as follows, 
      ```SFUN
      β ::= int | bool
      τ ::= (β1, ..., βn) -> β
      ```
      In the case of a type $τ$ such that $n = 0$ (the type of a function with no arguments), $τ$ may be written simply as $β$.
  - *Well-typed* terms
    - The set of well-typed terms can be defined using a relation
      $$
      \Gamma ⊢_\epsilon t: \tau
      $$
      - $\Gamma$ is a **variable environment**, or simply **environment**, given as a finite partial function from variables to base types. 
      - $\epsilon$ is a **function environment** assigning to each function name a type respecting its *arity*
        > i.e., $\begin{cases} ⟨f⟩ = 0 & &\epsilon(f)=\beta \\ ⟨f⟩ = n &n \geq 1 & \epsilon(f) = (β_1, ..., β_n) \to β\end{cases}$
      - $t$ is a SFUN term. 
      - $\tau$ is a type. 

##### 18.3. Typing

- Well-typedness relation

  - The well-typedness relation is inductively defined by the following system of axioms and rules. 
  - Note that in the case of the application of a function $f$. If $⟨f⟩ = 0$ then the rule reduces to an axiom, because there are no arguments to check. 
    $$
    \begin{matrix}
    \frac{}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon b : \text{ bool }} \\
    \frac{}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon n : \text{ int }} \\
    \frac{}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon x : \beta} &\text{if } \Gamma(x) = \beta \\
    
    \frac{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_1 : \text{ int }\ \Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_2 : \text{ int }}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_1 \text{ op } t_2 : \text{ int }} \\
    \frac{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_1 : \text{ int }\ \Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_2 : \text{ int }}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t_1 \text{ bop } t_2 : \text{ bool }} \\
    \frac{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon t : \text{ bool }}{\Gamma \vdash_\epsilon \neg t : \text{ bool }} \\
    
    ... \\
    
    \end{matrix}
    $$

- Typing SFUN programs

  - Given a program $P$​ in SFUN
    $$
    f(x_1, ..., x_{⟨f_1⟩}) = t_1 \\
    ... \\
    f(x_k, ..., x_{⟨f_k⟩}) = t_k
    $$
    and a function environment $\epsilon$, $P$ is a typeable, it for each equation $f_i(x_i, ... , x_{⟨f_i⟩}) = t_i$, there exists an environment $\Gamma_i$ and a type $\tau_i$​, such that
    $$
    \begin{cases}
    \Gamma_i \vdash_\epsilon f_i(x_i, ... , x_{⟨f_i⟩}) : \tau_i \\
    \Gamma_i \vdash_\epsilon t_i : \tau_i
    \end{cases}
    $$

  - Examples

    > e.g.
    >
    > Recall the program $P$​ that
    >
    > ```SFUN
    > infinity = infinity + 1
    > fortytwo(x) = 42
    > square(x) = x * x
    > 
    > ```
    >
    > >Given the environment $\epsilon$ where
    > >
    > >$\epsilon(\text{infinity}) = \text{int}$
    > >
    > >$\epsilon(\text{fortytwo}) = \text{(int)} \to \text{int}$
    > >
    > >$\epsilon(\text{square}) = \text{(int)} \to \text{int}$
    > >
    > >$P$ is a typeable program. All the equations are typeable with type `int`, the first in an empty environment and the latter two using an environment $\Gamma$, such that $\Gamma(x)=\text{int}$.

  - Proof
    - We can use proof <u>by induction</u> on SFUN programs directly.
      > e.g.
      >
      > Given that `fact(x) = if x <= 0 then 1 else x * fact(x - 1)`, prove that `fact(n) = n!` for all natural numbers. 
      >
      > >- Base case (n = 0)
      > >  - show that `fact(0) = 0! = 1`
      > >  - By the definition of `fact(x)`, $0 \leq 0$ evaluates to $\text{True}$, and then by the left-hand side of the conditional, `fact(0) = 1`, as expected. 
      > >- Induction hypothesis - Assume `fact(n) = n!`
      > >  - Show that `fact(n + 1) = (n + 1)!`
      > >  - `n + 1 <= 0` will evaluate to $\text{False}$. 
      > >    - By the right-hand side of the conditional, `fact(n + 1) = (n + 1) * fact((n + 1) - 1)` which is equal to `(n + 1) * fact(n)`. 
      > >    - By the inductive hypothesis,  this is equal to `(n + 1) * n!`, which is simply `(n + 1)!`.
