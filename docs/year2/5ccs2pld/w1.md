### 1. Programming Languages

##### 1.1. Introduction

- Terminology

  - **Programming language** - tools for writing software
    - Are used in several phases in the software development process
  - **Design method** - A design method is a guideline for producing a design *(e.g. functional or object-oriented design)*.
    - Older languages such as Fortran do not support any specific design method.
    - More modern languages were designed to support a specific design method
      > e.g. Haskell and CaML support functional design, Java and C++ support object-oriented design and programming.
    
      > Note.
      >
      > If the design method is not compatible with the language the programming effort increases.
    
  - **Programming paradigm** - A programming language may enforce a particular style of programming: a programming paradigm.

##### 1.2. Programming Paradigms

- Types

  - **Imperative Languages**
    - Programs are decomposed into computation steps, reflecting the computer architecture.
      > e.g. Fortran, C, Python, Java are imperative.

  - **Functional Languages**
    - Based on the mathematical notion of function. The focus is on what should be computed, not how it should be computed.
      > e.g. Lisp, Haskell, CaML, Scheme are functional.

  - **Logic Languages**
    - Programs describe a problem rather than defining an algorithmic implementation.
      > e.g. Prolog is the most well-known logic language.

  - **Object-oriented Languages**
    - This feature can be added to any of the above paradigms *(i.e., there are OO imperative languages, OO functional languages, etc)*.
      > e.g. Java, OCaML, Scala, Python, Ruby, F# are object-oriented.

- Components of a programming language
  - **Syntax** - Defines the form of programs
    > i.e. How expressions, commands, declarations are built and put together to form a program.

  - **Semantics** - Gives the meaning of programs
    >i.e. How they behave when they are executed.

  - **Implementations** - A software system that can read a program and execute it in a machine, plus a set of tools *(editors, debuggers, etc)*

### 2. Implementation Techniques

##### 1.1. Implementing a Programming Language

- Revision on Computer Architecture

  - Main components of a computer
    - Memory
    - Registers
    - Processor, with a a set of machine instructions for arithmetic and logic operations *(i.e., machine language)*
  - Structure
    - The operating system supplies higher-level primitives than those of the machine language *(e.g. input/output operations, file management system, editors)*.  
    - Language implementations are built on top of these. 
    - User programs form the top layer.
      > user programs
      >
      > > language implementation
      > >
      > > > operating system
      > > >
      > > > > machine

- Implemented methods
  - **Compiling** - programs into machine language
  - **Interpreting** - programs
  - **Hybrid Method** - combines compilation and interpretation

##### 1.2. Execution

- Definition

  - The execution of machine code occurs in a process called **fetch-execute cycle**.
  - Each machine instruction to be executed is moved from the memory, where programs reside, to the processor. 

- Fetch-execute cycle
  - Initialise program counter (in a register of the machine)
  - Repeat forever:
    - fetch the instruction pointed by the program counter
    - increment the program counter
    - decode and execute the instruction

> Note.
>
> When all the instructions in the program have been executed the control returns to the operating system (in a system where more than one program is running the process is more complex!).

##### 1.3. Compilation

- Definition

  - The **compiler** <u>translates the entire source language into machine language</u> that can be executed directly on the computer.
  - This method provides <u>fast program execution</u>.
- Main phases
  1. Lexical Analysis
  2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing)
  3. Type and Semantics Analysis
  4. Machine Code Generation

##### 1.4. Interpretation

- Definition

  - The program is executed <u>by an interpreter which simulates a machine</u> whose fetch-execute cycle deals with high-level program instructions.
  - In this case there is no translation. The interpreter produces a virtual machine for the language.

- Evaluation

  - Pros ✅
    - Easy to implement, 
    - Easy debugging of programs, 
    - Better error messages. 
  - Cons ❌
    - Slow execution

- Examples
  >e.g. 
  >
  >Simpler languages, and prototyping languages, are usually interpreted *(e.g. LISP, Unix Shell Scripts)*.

##### 1.5. Hybrid Implementation

- Definition

  - Some languages are implemented by <u>compilation to an intermediate language instead of machine language</u>. This intermediate language is then interpreted.

- Evaluation

  - Portability (pros)
    - Programs can be executed in any machine that has an interpreter for the intermediate language.
      >e.g. 
      >
      >Many functional languages are translated to abstract machine code which is then interpreted.

    - In Java, the intermediate form (bytecode) provides portability to any machine that has a bytecode interpreter.

- Some languages have both an interpreted and a compiled version
  - The interpreter is used to develop and debug programs which are later compiled to increase execution speed.

### 3. Syntax

##### 3.1. Definition

- Terminology

  - **Syntax** 
    - The syntax is concerned with <u>the form of programs</u>.
    - Components
      1. An **alphabet**  - the set of characters that can be used,
      2. A **set of rules** - indicating how to form expressions, commands, etc.
    - Two types
      1. **Concrete Syntax** - describes which <u>chains of characters</u> are well-formed programs.
      2. **Abstract Syntax** - describes <u>the syntax trees</u>, to which a semantics is associated.
  - **Grammar** - The concept that we used to <u>specify a language</u>. 

##### 3.2. Grammar

- Components

  - An **alphabet** $V=V_T \cup V_{NT}$​ (Terminals and non-terminals)
    - Terminal implies specific symbols
    - Non-terminal implies abstract symbols
  - **Rules**
  - **Initial Symbol**

> e.g.
>
> Rules (in Backus-Naur form)
>
> ```
> ## -- Concrete Syntax -- ##
> Exp   ::=  Num|Exp Op Exp
> Op    ::=  +|-|*|div
> Num   ::=  Digit|Digit Num
> Digit ::=  0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
> 
> Initial symbol: Exp
> Terminals: +, -, *, div, 0, ...9
> Non Terminals: Exp, Op, Num, Digit
> 
> 
> ## -- Problem: How is 1 - 2 - 3 read? -- ##
> ## This is Corresponding to 1 - (2 - 3)
> Exp -> 
> 	Exp Op Exp -> 
> 		Num Op Exp -> 
> 			Digit Op Exp -> 
> 				1 Op Exp -> 
> 					1 - Exp ->
> 						1 - Exp Op Exp -> ...
> ## This is Corresponding to (1 - 2) - 3
> Exp -> 
> 	Exp Op Exp -> 
> 		Exp Op Exp Op Exp -> 
> 			Num Op Exp Op Exp -> 
> 				Digit Op Exp Op Exp -> ...
> ```

##### 3.3. Remarks

- Abstract syntax 

  - Describes program representation.
  - Is not ambigous.
  - We will always work with the abstract syntax of the language and study the semantics of the main constructs of programming languages.

### 4. Semantics

##### 4.1. Definition

- Terminology

  - **Semantics**
    - A language defines <u>the meaning of programs</u>. 
      > i.e, How they behave when they are executed on a computer.
    
    - Different languages have different syntax and different semantics for similar constructs, but variations in syntax are often superficial. 
    - Types
      - **Static Semantics**, or **Typing**
        - The goal is to detect *(before the actual execution of the program)* programs that are syntactically correct but will give errors during execution.
          > e.g. 1 + ’a’
    
      - **Dynamic Semantics**, or **Semantics**
        - Specifies the meaning of programs.

##### 4.2. Formal and Informal Semantics

- Informal definitions

  - Often given by English explanations in language manuals, are often imprecise and incomplete. 

- Formal semantics

  - Important for
    - the implementation of the language
      > The behaviour of each construct is specified, providing an abstraction of the execution process which is <u>independent of the machine</u>.

    - programmers
      > A formal semantics provides tools or techniques to <u>reason about programs and prove properties of programs</u>.

    - language designers
      > A formal semantics allows to <u>detect ambiguities in the constructs</u> and suggests improvements and new constructs. 
      >
      > *e.g. influence of the study of the $λ$-calculus in the design of functional languages*

  - However, formal semantics descriptions can be complex, so <u>usually only a part of the language is formally defined</u>.

##### 4.3. Styles of Semantics

- **Operational semantics** ❗️
  > Note. 
  >
  > Will study this in this module. 
  
  - The meaning of each construct is given <u>in terms of computation steps</u>. The behaviour of the program during execution *can be described using a transition system* (abstract machine, structural operational semantics).
  - Useful for the implementation of the language and for proving correctness of compiler optimizations. 
  
- **Denotational semantics**

  - The meaning of expressions (and in general, the meaning of the constructs in the language) <u>is given in an abstract, mathematical way (using a mathematical model for the language)</u>. The semantics describes the effect of each construct.
  - Useful to reason and prove properties of programs.

- **Axiomatic semantics**

  - <u>Uses axioms and deduction rules</u> in a specific logic. Predicates or assertions are given before and after each construct, describing the constraints on program variables before and after the execution of the statement (precondition, postcondition).
  - Useful to reason and prove properties of programs.

##### 4.4. Operational Semantics & Transition Systems

- Transition system

  - Specified by
    - A set **Config of configurations or states**,
    - A binary relation $\rightarrow \subseteq \text{Config} \times \text{Config}$, which is called **transition relation** 
  - Notation
    - $c \rightarrow c'$ 
      - indicate that $c, c'$ are related by $\rightarrow$.
      - denotes a transition from $c$ to $c′$ (change of state).
    - $c \rightarrow^* c'$
      - The reflexive transitive closure of $→$. 
        > i.e., 
        >
        > $c \rightarrow^* c' \iff c \rightarrow c_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow c_n = c' \text{ where }n \geq 0$

  - Initial and Final *(or terminal)* subset of configurations
    > Note. 
    >
    > A sequence of transitions from $i \in I$ to $t \in T$ represents <u>a run of the program.</u>
    
    - Notation
      - Initial subset $I$
      - Final subset $T$ - $\text{For all } c \in T \text{ there is no } c' \implies c \rightarrow c'$
    - A transition system is **deterministic** if
      $\forall c, c_1, c_2: c \rightarrow c_1 \text{ and } c \rightarrow c_2 \implies c_1 = c_2$

- Abstract Machine

  - Definition
    - Useful for implementing a programming language, since they <u>describe the execution of each command</u>.
    - However, for users of the language they are not always easy to understand.
  - Structural approach
    - To operational semantics based on transition systems gives an inductive definition of the execution of a program.
      > i.e. Each command is described in terms of its components.
