#### What is the purpose of my interview?

Your interview is a chance for your prospective supervisors to get to know you. lt will allow them toassess your suitability for the programme, review your motivations for undertaking it, as well as your aspirations for future study. lnterviewers are not attempting to trick you, rather get a goodunderstanding of your research potential.

#### What will happen in my interview?

Your interview will take place online and will be between you and your prospective supervisor. lt will discuss points including:

- Your academic background.
- Your specific skills.
- How you think participating in a summer research experience will benefit you.

This may sound intimidating if you have not done an interview before, but there are a number of things that you can do to get ready.

---

1. Academic BG
2. Skills
3. Benifits

### Go over your application

Make sure you know what you've written in your application *(e.g. personal statement)* before the interview and be prepared to answer questions about your relevant experienceand areas of interest.

1. KURF robotic project maybe. 
   - Topic
     - Robot Manipulation
   - Content
     - Train DRL agent in a given environment
     - Learn the basical idea of common RL Algorithm
     - Select proper algorithm to achieve the best performance
   - RL Env (from Gymnasium-mujoco)
     - Basic env like Basic Lunar or Cart Pole
     - Atari Games
     - Gym-robot arm (Pushing or Catching)
   - RL Algorithm (from [OpenAI baseline](https://github.com/openai/baselines))
     - PPO - For continuous action space
     - DQN/D3QN - For discrete action space
   - Reflective essay and an Academic poster
2. The multi-agent project for researching the subjective of AI involving within the multi agent gaming environment
   - With the motivation - what role that AI agents play within a virtual environment, e.g. Games
   - Cooperate with friends from different subjects
   - Some focusing on developing the environment by game engine, and the methodology on applying multi-agent RL algorithm. Some focusing on giving a proper theory about describing the structure of the virtual environment. 
   - Just a draft currently. 

#### Know your motivations

- Think about why you want to undertake a summer research experience at Cambridge. 
- Perhaps you want to do an MPhil or a PhD at Cambridge in the future, you want to explore a potential thesis idea, or eventually undertake a career in research. 
- Show that you know how taking part in this programme will help you achieve your goals.

1. The program provides the thesis that I'm interested in and want to explore and gain pratical experience for them. 
2. I would like to purse a PhD program focusing on the topics that I'm interested with. 
   - Why this topic?
     - I would like to do research on something that could be pratical, especially for the wellbeing of the people. 
     - The concept of Embodied Agent is noval and fancy, which connect different subjects, which shows a great potential on promoting with that. (e.g., EmoLLM)
     - Recent breakthrough of VR and Generative AI also shows a potential that such kind of research will be more and more important in the future. 
   - Why PhD?
     - Research works is attactrive for me, rather than doing web app development. Furthermore
3. Pratice the skills for researching works, not only for training AI models but also particpting a complete process
4. Also find ideas for PhD RP as well. 

#### Prepare questions

- The interview is as much about you getting to know your supervisor and their expectations as it is about them assessing you.
- Therefore, before your interview think of any questions you might have for the supervisor.
- This might be about their previous research, supervision methods, or the structure of the programme.

1. The lab is mainly focusing on what aspect of the researching works, like for HCI or HRI, or simulating and expressing, or multimodal analysis, or reasoning, etc? 
2. In affective analysis, is it necessary to know the knowledge about related subjects, e.g., cognitive science, psychology or media (like computer-mediated communication) —— also for the preparation of the project
3. Applying multimodal technology to develop AI for human wellbeing.
4. About the project
   1. General content and project structure
   2. Expected Output
