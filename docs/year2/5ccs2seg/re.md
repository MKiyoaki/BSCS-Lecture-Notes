#### 1. Introduction to projects & project management

###### 1.1. Definition

- `Project` - a temporary process undertaken to <u>create a unique product</u>
  - Difference from operations
    - Projects are **unique & temporary**
    - Projects have **specific goals** and a **defined beginning and end**

###### 1.2. Issues in project management

- `Constraints` - Limitations in resources *like time, budget and scope*
- `People` - Managing and coordinating *team members* with diverse skills and ways of working
- `Communcation` - Ensuring effective *information flow*, avoiding breakdowns
- `Risk` - Identifying, assessing, and mitigating *potential issues*

###### 1.3. Project Life Cycle

- Initiating - clearly defining the <u>scope and purpose</u> of a project

- Planning - establishing <u>detailed plans</u> for how the project will be executed

- Executing - coordinating people and resources to <u>carry out the project plan</u>

- Monitoring & controlling - tracking, reviewing, and regulating progress and

  performance

- Closing - <u>finalizing</u> all project activities and completing deliverables

---

#### 2. Project Constraints

###### 2.1. Definition

- `Project Constraints` 
  - A limitation or restriction that hinders the flexibility of a project. 
  - Can arise from various factors, *including project scope budget, time, resources, quality, and risk*. 

###### 2.2. Recognition

- Recognizing factors that define the parameters within which a project must operate
  - Affecting its scope, 
  - schedule, 
  - budget, 
  - or quality

###### 2.3. Models of project constraints

- Iron Triangle 

  - Components - Time, cost, scope.

  - Concept

    - <u>Changing one element affects the others</u>, demonstrating the interdependence of constraints, with a delicate balance between them
    - The three factors affects the final quality

- Diamond Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, and quality.
  - Concept
    - Quality is added as a core constraint, emphasizing its importance in project management.
    - Recognizes that <u>a project may fail</u> despite meeting time and cost constraints if it lacks quality.

- PMBOK Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and stakeholders.
  - Concept
    - Includes a broader set of constraints, incorporating stakeholders and risk as crucial elements.
    - Acknowledges that project success is influenced by a broader set of factors beyond the traditional three constraints.

###### 2.4. Types of project constraints

> Different constraints are interconnected; altering one may affect others. 
>
> For example, increasing scope might impact cost and time

- **Cost/Budget Constraint** - Limitation on the <u>financial resources</u> available.
- **Time/Schedule Constraint** - Restrictions on the project's <u>timeline</u>.
- **Scope Constraint** - <u>Boundaries</u> defining what is and isn't part of the project.
- **Quality Constraint** - The standard of deliverables and project outcomes.
- **Risk Constraint** - <u>Potential threats</u> that may impact project success.
- **Resource Constraint** - Limitation on <u>people, equipment, or materials</u>. 

###### 2.5. Costs Constraints

- Types
  - `Direct costs` - Directly attributable to the project *(e.g., software development tools)*.
  - `Indirect costs` - Not project-specific but contribute to overall expenses *(e.g., office utilities)*.
- Why is costing a project difficult
  - **Evolving Requirements** - Software <u>requirements may change</u> over time, affecting project scope and thus costs.
  - **Uncertainties in Technology** - Rapid <u>technological advancements</u> can introduce unforeseen complexities and cost implications.
- Recognizing Cost constraints
  - **Thorough Cost Estimation** - Conduct comprehensive cost estimations to identify potential cost drivers and risks. 
  - **Regular Cost Monitoring** - Regularly monitor project expenses to identify deviations from the budget and take corrective actions.
  - **Proactive Risk Management** - Implement strategies to mitigate cost-related risks, such as identifying cost-saving opportunities or negotiating better pricing agreements.

> e.g. 
>
> The project budget is limited to $200,000, which includes expenses for software licenses, hardware, salaries, and other resources.

#### 3. Leadership & Authority

###### 3.1. Definition

- `Formal Authority` - The authority provided **by an organization or the law** to an individual 
  - Enabling them to carry out certain actions in accordance with their own will, and
  - Without the need to consult others.
  - **Role** - Typically associated with traditional, hierarchical organizations where power is top-down.
- `Informal Authority` - The authority that **a manager holds over their subordinates** due to certain qualities that the subordinates value in them.
  - **Role** - Is becoming increasingly important in networked, pluralistic organizations that need to rapidly adapt in a complex world.

###### 3.2. Lack of Authority

- Recognizing
  - A lack of **formal authority** - when there is confusion about roles and responsibilities, disagreements about who has the decision-making power, and risks and issues are not being formally managed.
  - A lack of **informal authority** - when there is a lack of admiration, credibility, respect, and trust among team members.
- Impact
  - Lack of **formal authority** can lead to
    - unclear responsibilities, 
    - stalled progress, 
    - unmanaged risks, and 
    - scope creep.
  - Lack of **informal authority** can lead to
    - reduced influence over attitudes and behaviors, and 
    - a lack of conformity with acceptance.

###### 3.3. Four Foundational Behaviors in Project Management

- Contents

  1. Not buying your story (lacking conviction and integrity)
  2. Being tone-deaf (using inappropriate language and humor)
  3. Disowning your accountability (ducking responsibility)
  4. Isolating yourself (the leader is rarely seen as they spend most of the time in their office)

- Benefits

  - Help build informal authority by 

    establishing the project manager as a credible, respectful, and accountable leader who is constantly present and communicating with the team.

- Applying the Four Foundational Behaviors

  - To apply these behaviors in practical situations, a **project manager** should
    1. communicate with conviction and integrity, 
    2. use appropriate language, 
    3. take responsibility for their actions and words, and 
    4. be a constant presence by managing by wandering around.
