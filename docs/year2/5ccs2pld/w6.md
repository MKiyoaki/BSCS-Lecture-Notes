### 12. General Concepts of Functional Programming

##### 12.1. Introduction

- Definitions
  - **Functional programs**
    - Programs consist entirely of functions.
    - It focus on what to be computed, rather than how it should be computed. 
  - **Functions** - A function can be defined in terms of other functions (previously defined by the programmer, in libraries or language primitives). 
- Features
  - **Strongly-typed** and have built-in memory management. 
    - Pros ✅
      - Shorter programs. 
      - Easier to understand. 
      - Easier to design, verify and maintain than imperative programs. 
    - Cons ❌
      - Usually slower than imperative programs.
      - Arguably less flexible.
- Example - **Haskell**
  - Introduction
    - A modern functional programming language.
    - GHC - Glasgow Haskell Compiler
    - GHCi - GHC interactive environment (interpreter)

##### 12.2. Syntax and Evaluation

- Syntax of Functional Programs

  - Notation

    - The notation is inspired by mathematical definition of functions by using *equations*

      > e.g., `square x = x * x`

  - Execution

    - The computer will evaluate and display the *results of the expressions* that the programmer writes, using the available functions. 

      >e.g., With the input of `square 6` will give a result `36`. 

    - Expressions may contain numbers, variables or names of functions. 

- Process

  - Steps

    > e.g.
    >
    > Assume an input `square 6` is received, the computer will
    >
    > 1. Use the definition of the function `square` and replace this expression by `6 * 6`.
    > 2. Use the predefined operation `*`, which will compute and give the result `36`.

    - The process of evaluating an expression is a *simplication process*, also called a *reduction or evaluation*. The goal is to obtain the value or normal form associated with the expression, by a series of reduction steps. 
    - We will use the notation $e \rightarrow e'$, that denotes the reduction from the expression $e$ to the expression $e'$.
    - The *meaning* of an expression is its value.

    >e.g.
    >
    >- `square 6` → `6 * 6` → `36`, so `36` is the *value/normal form* of the expression `square 6`. 
    >- `((3 + 1) + (2 + 1))` → `((3 + 1) + 3)` → `(4 + 3)` → `7`, so `7` is the value denoted by the expression `((3 + 1) + (2 + 1))`. There could also be another correct reduction with the same value. 

  - Properties

    - Unicity of normal forms
      - In (pure) functional languages, the value of an expression <u>is uniquely determined by its components</u>, and <u>is independent of the order of reduction</u>.
    - Non-termination
      - Not all reduction sequences lead to a value, some reduction sequences *do not terminate*.
      > e.g.
      >
      > For the function `infinity = infinity + 1`, the evaluation of `infinity` will never reach a normal form. 
      >
      > Considering a function `fortytwo x = 42`, for the expression `fortytwo infinity`  some reduction will terminate with the result of `42`. (Unicity)

- Strategies

  - Definition
    - The **strategy of evaluation** defines the reduction sequence that the language implements. The most popular strategies are the following
      1. **Call-by-name** (normal order)
         - Reduce first the application <u>using the definition of the function, and then the argument</u>. 
      2. **Call-by-value** (applicative order)
         - Evaluate <u>first the argument, and then the application</u> using the definition of the function. 
  - Properties
    - Different strategies require different number of reduction steps (*efficiency*).
    - Call-by-name <u>always finds the value if there is one</u>. 
    - Call-by-value is in general *more efficient*, but may fail to find a value. 
    - Haskell uses a strategy called **lazy evaluation**. 
      - Lazy evaluation guarantees that if an expression has a normal form, then the evaluator will find it. 
        >  lazy evaluation = call-by-name + sharing
      - Lazy evaluation <u>defers the evaluation of expressions until their results are needed</u> for other components.

### 13. Funciton Definitions

##### 13.1. Functional Definition and Application

- Function Values

  - Functions are also values, even though we cannot display or print them. 
    >Note. 
    >
    >In mathematics, a function is a mapping that associates to each element of a given type $A$, called the *domain* of the function, an element of type $B$​, *codomain*.
    >
    >$f : A \mapsto B$
    >
    >If a function $f$ of type $A \mapsto B$ is applied to an argument $x$ of type $A$, it gives a result ($f x$) of type $B$​.
    
    >e.g.
    >
    >Here, the syntax to associate a type to a function is:
    >
    >`square :: Integer → Integer`
    >
    >`fortytwo :: Integer → Integer`

- Syntax of Function Definitions
  - Functions are defined <u>in terms of equations</u>.
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > square x = x * x
    > ```
    >
    > ```haskell
    > min x y = if x < y then x else y
    > ```

  - We can also use <u>conditional equations (or guarded equations)</u>. 
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > sign x
    > 		| x < 0 = -1
    > 		| x == 0 = 0
    > 		| x > 0 = 1
    > ```

- Function Applications
  - Application is denoted by juxtaposition: `(f x)`

    > e.g.
    >
    > `(square 3)`
    >
    > `(sign (-5))`
    >
    > `(min 3 (-5))`

  - To avoid writing too many brackets there are some conventions:

    - Precedence over other operations

      > `square 3 + 1` means `(square 3) + 1`

    - Associates to the left

      > `square square 3` means `(square square) 3`

    - Will not write outrmost brackets

      > `square 3` instead of `(square 3)`

##### 13.2. Advanced Function Definitions

- Recursive Definitions

  - Syntax
    - In the definition of a function $f$ we can use the function $f$​ itself
      > e.g.
      >
      > ```haskell
      > fact :: Integer -> Integer
      > fact n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * (fact (n - 1))
      > ```

    - Recursive definitions are evaluated by simplification, as any other expression.
      > e.g.
      >
      > `fact 0` →  `if 0 == 0 then 1 else 0 * (fact (0 - 1))` → `if True then 1 else 0 * (fact (0 - 1))` → `1`
      >
      > Note the operational semantics of the conditional.

    - When evaluating the program, the computer will firstly evaluate the condition.
      - If the result is `True` - evaluate only the expression in the left branch (`then`).
      - If the result is `False` - evaluate only the expression in the right branch (`else`).
    - Error statement
      -  `error` is a predefined function that takes a string as argument (as the error message). 
      > e.g.
      >
      > ```haskell
      > fact :: Integer -> Integer
      > 
      > fact n
      > 		| n > 0 = n * (fact (n - 1)) 
      > 		| n == 0 = 1
      > 		| n < 0 = error "negative argument"
      > ```
      >
      > The program with the `fact n` will terminate iff `n>=0`. In order to make sure the sequence will terminate we write a branch for the negative input like above. 

- Definations by Pattern Matching

  - Introduction
    - Functions may also be defined using *pattern matching* on their arguments. 
    - An important feature of functional languages.
  - Upon evaluation the argument of a function is compared against those of the possible definitions, in the order they are provided, until 
    - either <u>a match is found</u>, 
    - or <u>the patterns are exhausted</u>.
  > e.g.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > fact :: Integer -> Integer 
  > 
  > fact 0 = 1
  > fact n = n * (fact (n - 1))
  > ```

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > fact :: Integer -> Integer
  > 
  > -- Condition
  > fib n = if n == 1 || n == 2 then 1 else (n - 1) + (n - 2)
  > 
  > -- Guarded Equations
  > fib n
  > 		| n <= 2 = 1
  > 		| n > 2 = (n - 1) + (n - 2)
  > 
  > -- Pattern Matching
  > fib 1 = 1
  > fib 2 = 1
  > fib n = (n - 1) + (n - 2)
  > 
  > ```

- Unravelling the last definition
  - `!!`  - the *indexing* operator. It returns the n-th element of a list (the first position is 0). 
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > [3,5,2,1] !! 0 = 3
    > [3,5,2,1] !! 2 = 2
    > ```

  - `:` - the "cons" operators for lists.
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > [3,1,2] == 3 : [1,2] == 3 : 1 : [2] == 3:1:2:[]
    > ```

  - `zipWith f a b` - takes a function `f` and applies it to the elements at the same positions in the list `a` and `b`, returning a new list with the result
    >  e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > zipWith (+) [1, 3, 4] [3, 2, 5] = [4, 5, 9]
    > ```

  > e.g.
  >
  > Consider the following program
  >
  > ```haskell
  > fib n = xs !! (n - 1) where xs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) xs (tail xs)
  > ```
  >
  > `xs` is a list that starts with the elements `[1,1]`. The rest of the list is the result of the application of `zipWith (+)` to itself and its tail. Let us have a look at these lists:
  >
  > ```haskell
  > xs  [1,1,2,3,...]
  > tail xs  [1,2,3,...]
  > zipWith (+) xs (tail xs) [2,3,5,...]
  > ```

- Local Definitions

  - Motivation
    - As in mathematics, we can write `f x = a + 1 where a = x / 2` or `f x = let a = x / 2 in a + 1`
    - The syntax, `let ... in` and `where`, is used to introduce *local definitions*, available just on the right-hand side of the equation that we are writing. 
    - We can write several local definitions:
      ```haskell
      f x = square (successor x)
          where square z = z * z ; successor x = x + 1
      ```

  - Evaluation of local definitions
    - Syntax `e[a] where a = e'`
      - Evaluate `e′`, obtaining a result `r`
      - Replace `a` by `r` in `e`
      - Evaluate `e{a → r}`
    - Example
      >e.g.
      >
      >```haskell
      >magnitude a b = sqrt (asq + bsq) where asq = a * a ; bsq = b * b
      >
      >magnitude 3 4 -> sqrt (asq + bsq) where asq = 3 * 3 ; bsq = 4 * 4 
      >-> sqrt (asq + bsq) where asq = 9 ; bsq = 4 * 4
      >-> sqrt (9 + bsq) where bsq = 4 * 4
      >-> sqrt (9 + bsq) where bsq = 16
      >-> sqrt (9 + 16) -> sqrt 25 -> 5
      >```

- Arithmetic functions

  - Arithmetic operators are also functions (primitives), used in infix notation
    > e.g. `3 + 4`

  - We can use them in prefix notation if we enclose them in brackets
    > e.g. `(+) 3 4`

  - `(+)` denotes the curryfied version of `+`
    > ```haskell
    > + :: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
    > (+) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    > ```

  - Standard functions use prefix syntax by default, but may be made infix by quoting them
    > e.g., `10 'div' 2`

  - Examples
    > e.g.
    >
    > - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` are left associative.
    >
    > - `3 - 1 - 2` should be read as `(3 - 1) - 2`
    >
    > - `(+) 1` is the successor function
    >
    > - `(*) 2` is the function that doubles its argument
    >
    > - Application has priority
    >
    >   `square 1 + 4 * 2` means `(square 1) + (4 * 2)`

##### 13.3. Functional Composition

- Definition

  - Functions are the building blocks of functional languages. 
  - One way of combining functions is by *composition*, written infix as `f * g`
  - Composition is itself a (pre-defined) function. We can only compose functions whose types match. 
    > ```haskell
    > (*) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c) 
    > (f * g) x = f (g x)
    > ```

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > len :: [Int] -> Int					-- sample = double · len (valid)
    > len [] = 0									-- tilt = len · double (error)
    > len (x : xs) = 1 + (len xs) 
    > double :: Int -> Int 				-- sample :: [Int] -> Int
    > double x = 2 * x						-- sample [1,2,3] = 6
    > 
    > ```

### 14. Curryfication

##### 14.1. Curried functions 

- Functions in Haskell take <u>no more than one argument</u>.

  - Applying a function to *n* > 1 arguments yields another function with *n* − 1 arguments. This allows one to create new functions by partial application.
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > plus :: Int -> Int -> Int 
    > plus x y = x + y
    > 
    > plus 3 :: Int -> Int 
    > (plus 3) 2 :: Int 
    > (plus 3) 2 = 5
    > ```

  - Multiple arguments can be passed as one in a tuple but this does not allow partial application.
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > plusTuple :: (Int, Int) -> Int 
    > plusTuple (x,y) = x + y
    > ```

  - We can convert between curried and uncurried functions using the primitive functions `curry` and `uncurry`.
    `curry :: ((a, b) -> c)->(a -> b -> c) | uncurry :: (a -> b -> c)->((a, b) -> c)`
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```haskell
    > plus :: Int -> Int -> Int
    > plus = curry plusTuple
    > ```

- Examples
  > e.g. 
  >
  > Write the following function in Haskell. This function should return the sum of the natural numbers up to *n*. So `sumNat 0 = 0`, `sumNat 1 = 1`, `sumNat 2 = 3`, and so forth.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > sumNat :: Int -> Int
  > 
  > -- With conditionals
  > sumNat n = if n == 0 || n == 1 then n else n * (n - 1) / 2
  > 
  > -- With guards
  > sumNat n
  > 			| n == 0 = n
  > 			| n == 1 = n
  > 			| n > 1 = n * (n - 1) / 2
  > 			
  > ```
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > Write the following function in Haskell. This function checks whether time $t_1$ given as a tuple $(h_1, m_1, s_1)$ comes before time $t_2$ also given as a tuple $(h_2, m_2, s_2)$​, returning `true` or `false` as appropriate.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > before :: (Int,Int,Int) -> (Int,Int,Int) -> Bool
  > 
  > before (h1, m1, s1) (h2, m2, s2) = (h1 * 60 * 60 + m1 * 60 + s1) > (h2 * 60 * 60 + m2 * 60 + s2)
  > ```
  > 
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > Write the following function in Haskell. This function should return the absolute value of the value given to it as argument. 
  >
  > ```haskell
  > abs_val :: Int -> Int
  > 
  > abs_val n = if n >= 0 then n else -n
  > ```
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > Write the following function in Haskell. This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$​​ in a 2-dimensional plane.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > dist :: (Float,Float) -> (Float,Float) -> Float
  > 
  > dist (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = sqrt ((x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1))
  > ```
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > Write the following function in Haskell. This function should return the largest element of a non-empty list of integers. If the list is empty, the function should display an error message.
  >
  > ```haskell
  > largest :: [Int] -> Int
  > 
  > largest [] = error "Empty list"
  > largest [x] = x
  > largest (x:xs) = max x (largest xs)
  > ```
