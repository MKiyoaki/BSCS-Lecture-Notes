***Theorm 5.1*** Recap for Asymptotic Notation

- Big Oh Notation (upper bounds)

  - A function $g:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ **eventually dominates** a function $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ if there is some constant $c>0$ such that

    $\exist N \in \mathbb{N}\ (\forall n > N; f(n)\leq c \cdot g(n))$

  - $f(n) = \Omicron(g(n))\iff f(n)$ is eventually dominated by $g(n)$

- Big Omega Notation (lower bounds)

  - $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))\iff f(n)$ eventually dominates $g(n)$

- Big Theta Notation (tight bounds)

  - $\Theta(g(n)) = \Omicron(g(n)) \cap \Omega(g(n))$

> $\Theta(1)\approx\Theta(\log_2(n))<\Theta(\sqrt{n})<\Theta(n)\approx\Theta(n\log_2(n))<\Theta(n^2)<\Theta(n^3)<...<\Theta(2^n)<\Theta(n!)$

***Theorm 5.2*** Decision Problem

Every problem, for which the possible answers are **YES** or **NO** (or, **True** or **False**) can be interpreted as a language. 

$L_P=\{w \in \Sigma^*: w\ is\ an\ instance\ of\ the\ problem\ P\ whose\ answer\ is\ YES\}$

***Theorm 5.3*** Complexity Classes N vs NP

- Time Complexity 

  Given a (terminating) machine $M$, define a function $t_M:\Sigma^*\to\mathbb{N}$, then

  $t_M(w):=\{number\ of\ steps\ required\ to\ terminate\ on\ input\ w\in\Sigma^*\}$

  We define the **worst-case time** complexity as $t_M:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, then

  $t_M(w):=max\{t(w):all\ words\ w\ of\ length\ n\}$

- (Deterministic) Polynomial time

  A language $L$ is said to be solvable in **polynomial time** if there exists a **deterministic Turing Machine** $M$ such that

  1. $M$ accepts $L$, 
  2. $T_M \in \Omicron(n^k)$ is eventually dominated by a **polynomial function**. 

  $P = \{all\ problems\ decidable\ in\ polynomial\ time\}$

- Non-deterministic Polynomial time

  A langauge L is said to be solvable in **non-deterministic polynomial time** if there exists a **non-deterministic Turing Machine** $M$ such that

  1. $M$ accepts $L$, 
  2. $T_M \in \Omicron(n^k)$ is eventually dominated by a **polynomial function**. 

  $NP = \{all\ problems\ decidable\ in\ non-deterministic\ polynomial\ time\}$

> In other words, Polynomial time is like $\Omicron(1), \Omicron(\log(n)), \Omicron(n^a),...$ is acceptable for computer, while Non-polynomial time like $\Omicron(n!), \Omicron(a^n)$ not. Therefore, 
>
> $P$ are the questions that <u>can be solved</u> in polynomial time, and $NP$ are the questions that <u>their answers can be vertified</u> in polynomial time. 
>
> $NP$ includes $P$.

#### 6. NP-Completeness

***Theorm 6.1.*** Computable Functions and Polynomial Reductions 

- A function $f:\Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ on words from $\Sigma^*$ is **computable** if there is a (deterministic) Turing Machine $M_f$ such that, 

  1. $M_f$ **accepts** all input words $w \in \Sigma^*$, 

  2. When **started** in configuration $(q_{init}, \epsilon, w)$ the machine eventually **terminates** in configuration $(q_{accept}, \epsilon, f(w))$. 

​	i.e., the machine terminates the contents of the tape from $w$ to $f(w)$ and returns the tape head to the start of the word. 

​	i.e., $f$ is computable in polynomial $\iff$ $f$ is **computable** if $M_f$ terminates in **polynomial-time**

- A **polynomial reduction** from a problem $X$ to a problem $Y$ is a function $f:\Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ **computable in polynomial-time** such that $w \in X \iff f(w) \in Y$. 

​	$X\leq_p Y$ means $X$ is polynomial reducible to $Y$. 

***Theorm 6.2.*** NP-hardness

A problem $X$ is said to be **NP-hard** if *every problem* in NP can be polynomial reduced to it. 

$Y\leq_p X$ for all $Y\in NP$ ($X$ is at least as hard as *every* NP-problem)

***Theorm 6.3.*** If $Y$ is NP-hard and $Y \leq_p X$, then $X$ is also NP-hard. 

***Proof.*** 

>Suppose that (i) $Y$ is NP-hard and (ii) $Y \leq_p X$, 
>
>By (i) we have that $Z \leq_p Y$ for all $Z \in NP$, 
>
>By (ii) and **transitivity** we have that $Z\leq_pY\leq_pX$ for all $Z \in NP$. 
>
>> A typical approach to demonstrating that a problem is **NP-hard** is to show that $SAT$ is reducible to it. i.e. that $SAT \leq_p X$.

***Theorm 6.4.*** NP-completeness

A problem $X$ is said to be **NP-complete** if (i) $X$ is **NP-hard** (lower bound) and (ii) $X$ also **belongs to NP** (upper bound).

>The Boolean Statisfiability problem, The Clique problem, The Hamiltonian Cycle problem, ...
>
>Games like Lemmings or Pokemon, ...

#### 7. The Clique Problem

***Theorm 7.1.*** The Clique Problem **CLIQUE**

**Input)** An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, an integer $k>2$. 

**Output)** $True$ if and only if $G$ contains a *clique* of size $k$. 

>  A *clique* of size k is an undirected graph that every distinct two vertices have a edge. 

***Theorm 7.2.*** The Clique Problem **CLIQUE** belongs to **NP**. 

***Proof.*** 

> Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and integer $k>2$, such that
>
> 1.  We can decide whether $G$ contains a clique of size $k$ by checking **every subset** of vertices of size $k$. However, there are $()$ possible subsets, i.e., it is **NOT** polynomial! 
>
> 2. A non-deterministic machine can check each subset in **parallel**, each subset requires us to check only $k^2$ edges, which is polynomial. 

***Theorm 7.3.*** The Boolean Statisfiability problem is polynomially reducible to the Clique finding problem. i.e., $SAT\leq_pCLIQUE$

***Proof.*** 

>Given formula $F$ in Conjunctive Normal Form, 
>
>1. We want to construct a graph $G_F=(V,E)$ and choose an integer $k>2$, such that 
>
>   $F\ is\ satisfiable \iff G_F\ has\ a\ clique\ of\ size\ k$. 
>
>2. Define $G_F=(V,E)$ as follows: 
>
>   $F=(P \or \neg Q \or R)\and(\neg P \or \neg Q \or \neg R)\and(P \or Q \or \neg R)$
>
>3. Choose appropriate integer $k$ such that $k=\#clauses\ in\ F$

#### 8. Hamiltonian Cycle Problem

***Theorm 8.1.*** The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem **HAMILTONIAN**

**Input)** An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$. 

**Output)** $True$ if and only if $G$ contains a *Hamiltonian Cycle*. 

> A *Hamiltonian cycle* is ...

***Theorem 8.2.*** The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem **HAMILTONIAN** belongs to **NP**.
