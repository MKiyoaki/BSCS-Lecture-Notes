### 7.1. One-Way Function

##### 7.1.1. One-Way Function

- Motivation
  - Consider the general cryptographic schema.
    - Types
      - Symmetric algorithms.
      - Asymmetric (or public key) algorithms. 
    - Encryption and decryption should be easy, if keys are known.
    - Security depends only on secrecy of the key, not on the algorithm.
- Definition
  - A funciton $f: X \to Y$ is a one-way function if it is *easy* to compute $f(x)$ for all $x \in X$, but given only $y \in Y$ it is hard or infeasible to compute $x \in X$ so that $f(x) = y$.

  - Easy

    - Generally, defined to mean a problem that can be solved in polynomial time as a function of input length. 

      > i.e.,  If input length is $n$ bits, then time to compute function is proportional to $n^a$, where $a$ is a fixed constant. Denote it as $\text{poly}(n)$.

  - Hard

    - Effort to solve problem grows faster than polynomial time as a function of input size.

      > e.g.
      >
      > Time to invert the function proportional to $2^n$ for input length $n$ bits.

- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > Square root
  >
  > If you know $x=512$, then $f(x)= x^2 = 512^2 = 262144$ is easy to compute.
  >
  > If you know $f(x) = 262144$, then $x = \sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{262144}$ is hard to compute. 

- One-way Function in Cryptography

  - Encryption is (very) easy whereas decryption is (very) difficult.
  - The idea is: $f(x)$ acts as a public key and $x$ as a private key.
