#### 10. Flow Control for Transport Layer

###### ***Theorem 10.1.*** Sliding Windows

- Definition
  - `Flow Control` - avoid a situation in which the sender sends data too fast, and the receiver is unable to receive/process it reliably. 
  - TCP uses flow control protocol based on *a sliding window mechanism*. 
    - In each TCP segment, the receiver specifies in **the receive window field** - the amount of additional data (in bytes)
    - The data is willing to buffer for the connection. 

- Sliding Window

  >  Think of TCP sequence numbers and receive windows as a clock: 
  >
  > - The receive window <u>shifts</u>: each time the receiver receives and acknowledges a new segment of data. 
  > - Once it runs out of sequence numbers: the sequence number loops back to 0.
  > - A receiver advertises a window size of 0: stop sending data. 

Example 10.1. 



> ```mermaid
> 	sequenceDiagram
> 		Client ->> Server: data=2KB, SEQ=0
> 		Server ->> Client: ACK=2048, WIN=2048
> 		Client ->> Server: data=2KB, SEQ=2048
> 		Server ->> Client: ACK=4096, WIN=0
> 		Note left of Client: Sender is BLOCKED
> 		Server ->> Client: ACK=4096, WIN=2048
> 		Note left of Client: Sender is ENABLED
> 		Client ->> Server: data=1KB, SEQ=4096
> 		
> ```
>
> - To make the protocol robust to potential loss of messages, the sender starts the persist timer. 
> - If no subsequent window size update is received from the receiver (because it is lost or corrupt), when the persist timer expires, the TCP sender attempts recovery by sending a small packet so that the receiver responds by sending another acknowledgement containing the new window size.

#### 11. Web Layer

###### ***Theorem 11.1.*** HTTP Message

- Definition
  - `Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)` - Used to load webpages using hypertext links. 
  - `HTTP Message` - Used to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. 
- Component
  - `Start Line` - Describing the requests to be implemented. Always a single line. 
    - Request: 
      - One of the HTTP methods
      - An abosulte URL path
      - The HTTP version
    - Response: 
      - The HTTP version
      - A status code
      - A status text
  - `Headers` - Optional. Set of HTTP headers specifying the request or describing the body of the message. 
  - `Empty Line` - Indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent. 
  - `Body` - Optional. Containing the data(request) or the document(response). 

###### ***Theorem 11.2.*** Naming of Resources

- `Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)` - A compact string of characters for identifying a resource (abstract or physical)

  > i.e., URI is a name for a resource. 

  - The names follow a well-defined syntax and are intended to reference resources *[RFC7230]*

  > e.g. 
  >
  > `https:` // `www.example.com` `/some/hierachial/path` ? `key1=value1` # `section`
  >
  > `scheme` // `hostname` `path info` ? `query string` # `fragment`

  - Opacity of URIs
    - Used to refer to a resource. 
    - Compare two URIs. 
    - Clients are not meant to look at the contents of the URI string to gain other infomation. 

- URI and Variants

  > URL\URN $\in$ URI $\in$ IRI

  - `URL` - Uniform Resource Locator
  - `URN` - Uniform Resource Name
  - `URI` - Uniform Resource Identifier
  - `IRI` - Internationalized Resource Identifier

#### 12. The Web Architecture: a network of named "resources"

***Theorem 12.1.*** Web

- The Web - **a network of sources**
  - Does not limit the nature of a resource
  - Defines an interface that might be used to interact with resources
  - **HTTP** of the web provides a uniform interface to Web resources
  - Client/Server model is adopted: 
    - Client: desiring to interact with a resource (according to its lifecycle)
    - Server: “hosting” the resource
  - Each resource is identified by a **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** *[RFC7230]*
  - Using HTTP, a client can interact with a resource by sending a request message to the target URI

***Theorem 12.2.*** Resources 

- Definiton

  Can be anything that has identity (Including abstract things)

  > e.g. document, image, service, a collection of resources, ..., friendship, ...

  Not all resources are network retrievable

  > e.g. human beings, corporations...

- Lifecycle of a resource - "CRUD"

  - `POST` - Create *(Does not Exist)*
  - `GET` - Read *(Exist)*
  - `PUT` - Update *(Exist)*
  - `DELETE` - Delete *(No longer Exist)*

- Representation & Resources

  > `Identifier` =*identifies*=> `Resources` =*is represented by*=> `Representation`

  - A resource can be anything that has identity. 
  - All interactions with resources are mediated by the uniform interface provided by HTTP. 
  - Only through the communication of messages to some independent actor on the other side

***Theorem 12.3.*** Representation

- Definition - The abstraction to represent the current or desired state of that resource in communications. 

  In HTTP, a "representation" is information that is: 

  - Intended to reflect a past, current, or desired state of a given resource, 
  - In a format that can be readily communicated via the protocol, 
  - A set of representation metadata, and
  - A potentially unbounded stream of representation data.

- Take Home Message - Universe of discourse at higher-level of abstraction than in networking layers

  >  resources can be documents, data, streams, people, organisations, relations, concepts

  - Key concepts
    - Resource
    - Representation
    - Naming
  - A Web of Resources
  - Computational aspect of a resource: 
    - Able to change state, and
    - evolving according to a lifecycle. 
  - Uniform interfacing to resources

#### 13. HTTP Messages Contents and Encoding

###### ***Theorem 13.1.*** Content-Type

- Definition

  - `Content-Type` - An entity-field that specifies nature of the data in the body of an HTTP message. 

- Components

  - **Media type**

    - Can be discrete or composite. 

    > e.g. 
    >
    > ``````
    > media-type = type "/" subtype ( ";" parameter )* 
    > type = token
    > subtype = token
    > parameter = token "=" ( token / quoted-string )
    > ``````

  - **Subtype** identifier

  - (Optional) **Auxiliary information**

- Media types

  - Discrete media types

    >e.g. 
    >
    >text, image, audio, video, application, ...
    
  - Composite media types - Multipart Messages 
  
    The ability of creating composite messages
  
    > e.g. 
    >
    > ```
    > curl -H "Content-Type: multipart/mixed"
    > 		 -F "content1={"param1": "value1"};type=application/json" 
    >      -F "content2=hello;type=text/plain;charset=utf-8” 
    >      http://localhost:8080/some/url
    > ```

###### ***Theorem 13.2.*** Character sets

- Definition

  > e.g. 
  >
  > Context-type: text.html: 
  >
  > `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">`

  - Parameter `charset ` - Specified in the content-type field for "text/plain" data. 

- Common charsets

  - American National Standard for Information Interchange (ASCII) 
    - `ASCII` - Was designed in the early 60's, as a standard character set for computers and electronic devices. 
    - 128 characters (7 bits) including digits, latin letters (upper and lower), symbols, punctuation and control characters. 


  - US-ASCII (7 bits)
  - ISO-8859-1 (8 bits)
  - UTF-8 (variable length 1-4 bytes)
    - Internationalization - Unicode (utf-8)


  - Base 64 Enconding

    - Definition

      - Designed to allow arbitrary binary data to be encoded us-ascii form.
      - i.e., To be sent on channels that only reliably support text content. 

      > e.g. 
      >
      > `Encode [237, 162]`
      >
      > 1. Convert the values to binary, 
      >
      >    `[237, 162] = 11101101 10100010`
      >
      > 2. Split into 6-bit chunks (padding with OS), denote *missing chunk =*: 
      >
      >    `11101101 10100010` + `00` + `=`
      >
      > 3. Lookup values in **base64 table**: 
      >
      >    `59` -> `7`
      >
      >    `26` -> `a`
      >
      >    `8` -> `I`
      >
      > 4. Final coding
      >
      >    `7aI`
