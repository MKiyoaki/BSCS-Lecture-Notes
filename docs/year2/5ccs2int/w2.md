### 5. Constraint Satisfaction Problem

##### 5.1. Introduction to CSP

- Introduction

  - Components
    - A finite set of variables $X = \{x^1, ..., x^i\}$​
      - Defines all elements that need to be given a value in the problem. 
    - A set of domains $D = \{D^1, ..., D^i\}$​​
      - Defines what possible values can be assigned <u>to each variable</u>, where the colors can be represented as $\{v^1, ..., v^j\}$
    - A set of constraints $C = \{C^1, ..., C^k\}$​
      - The rules that dicate a relation <u>between variables</u> in $X$​. 
      - Each constraint $C^i$ is a pairing of scope and relation. 

- Examples

##### 5.2. Solving CSP

- Process

  - States
    - Assignments of variables to values within domain. 
  - Initial State
    - No variables assigned. 
  - Action
    - Assign a value to any unassigned variable, provided it does not violate a constraint. 
    - If no legal assignments, return **failure**. 
  - Goal Test
    - All variables are assigned values, satisfying all constraints. 

- Algorithm

  - Challenge
    - Reducing the number of states (assignments) explored (so to reduce the complexity of the algorithm). 
      - Complete search tree is only of depth $n$​ variables. *i.e., one layer of the tree for each assignment*. 
      - But if there are $m$ possible values *(i.e., domain size)*, leading to $n! xm^n$ paths through the tree. 
  - Backtracking Search
    - Pseudo code
    - It is a variation of *Depth-First-Search*
      - Single-variable assignments
      - For-each assignment. 

- Optimization by heuristic methods

  - Chossing **variable** methods

    1. Most constrained variable

       - Choose the variable <u>with the fewest legal values of the domain</u>. 
  
       - Minimum remaining values (MRV) heuristic. 
  
    2. Most constraining variable
  
       - Assign this variable <u>with the most constraint (edges) on the remaining values for other variables.</u>
  
         > i.e. The value that most constraining for other variables. 
  
  - Choosing value methods
  
    1. Least contraining value
       - The value that rules out the fewest values in the remaining variables. (Make the remaining variables have more chocies)
  
  - Forward checking
  
    1. Keep track of remaining legal values for unassigned variables. 
    2. Terminate search when any variable has no legal values.
    3. **Forward checking** propagates information for assigned to unassigned variables. 
    
  - Constraint Propagation
  
    - Forward checking only detects constraints *early*. 
  
    - Constraint propagation enforces constraints. 
  
      - When choosing a value $a$ for a vairable $X$, if $X-Y$ has the constraint, then the algorithm will also delete $a$ from the domain of variable $Y$​. 
      - i.e., Check the arc consistency. 
  
    -  Arc Consistency
  
      - Detects failure earlier than forward checking.
      - Can be run before or after each assignment is made.
      -  Arc Consistency Algorithm. 
  
    - The value of Constraint Propagation
  
      - Constraint Propagation for a problem is often faster than traditional state-space search.
  
        - State-Space Search only cares if a state is the goal, not whether it is **valid**.
        - Heuristics can guide the search, not immediately obvious what a good heuristic is for this problem.
  
      - Constraint Propagation eliminate <u>areas of the state space that are no longer relevant</u>.
  
        > e.g.
        >
        > $\{\text{SA = blue}\}$​
        >
        > - This state has $3^5 (243)$ possible states for neighbouring values. But a lot of these are invalid.
        > - With constraint propagation, there is only $2^5(32)$ possible states. Reduction of 87%. 
        >
        > So enables dense or intractable problems to be searched through much faster.
