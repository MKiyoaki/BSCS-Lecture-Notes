### 3.1. Introduction to Turing Machine

##### 3.1.1. Turing Machine

- Introduction
  - **Turing Machines** (TM) are similar to finite automata, but they have an **infinite tape** for memory.
  - TMs also have a **head** that moves left and right along the tape.
    - The head can **write** a symbol to the tape.
    - The head can **read** a symbol from the tape.
  - The machine starts from an initial state, and with the tape containing only an input string (it is blank everywhere else).
- Definition
  - A TM is a tuple $(X,Q,\Gamma,q_i,F,\delta)$, where:
    - $X$ is an alphabet (finite set of atomic symbols);
    - $Q = \{q_0, q_1, ..., q_n\}$ is a finite set of states; 
    - $\Gamma$ is the set of symbols that can be stored on the tape, we assume $\{◦, •\} ⊆ \Gamma$, which are *blank* and *marker* symbols;
    - $q_i ∈ Q$ is the initial state;
    - $F = \{q_{accept},q_{reject}\} ⊆ Q$ are terminating states; and
    - $δ : Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}$ is the transition function.
  - The machine starts from an initial state, and with the tape containing only an input string (it is blank everywhere else).
  - We assume the head is positioned in the first symbol of the input string. The machine will make transitions depending on the symbol that the head reads, until a final state is reached.
  - The transition function now maps a `(state, symbol)` to a `(state, symbol, direction)`.
    - The direction $(L,R)$ tells the head which way to move $(\text{Left}, \text{Right})$. 
    - Transition notation: `read / write / move`.
- Process
  - Initially the tape stores the input word, the head is in the first symbol of the input string, and the machine is in the state $q_i$ .
  - As the computation proceeds, the situation of the machine, or **configuration**, is described by a triple: 
    - the current state, the contents of the tape, and the position of the head in the tape.
  - The word is accepted Iff the TM reaches $q_{accept}$ and rejected if it reaches $q_{reject}$. The machine can also loop forever.
  
- Example
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > The following machine recognises the language $\{1^{2^n} | n ≥ 0\}$, that is, the language of the strings that contain a number of 1s which is a power of 2.
  >
  > Informal description:
  >
  > 1. If the head is on blank when we start, reject.
  > 2. Starting on the first `1`, move to the end of the string (i.e. the first blank symbol), changing every other `1` into `•`:
  >    - If the tape contained just one `1`, accept. 
  >    - If the number of `1`s was odd, reject.
  > 3. Return the head to the beginning of the input.
  > 4. Repeat.
  >
  > The idea is that each iteraction changes half of the 1s into $•$. If the number of ones is a power of 2, we will eventually end up with just one 1 and accept the input.

##### 3.1.2. Variants of TM

- Types

  - There are many variations to TMs, for example:

    - Non-deterministic transitions:

      > The transition function returns a set: 
      >
      > - for the same state and symbol read, there may be several alternative transitions. 
      > - One of them will be chosen non-deterministically.

    - Multiple tapes:

      > The machine has several tapes and corresponding reading/writing heads. 
      >
      > - The transition function defines which is the next state, depending on the tuple of symbols read on the tapes, and indicates which symbol should be written in each tape.

  - All these variants of TMs are **computationally equivalent**.

##### 3.1.3. The Universal TM

- Introduction

  - It is possible to define a **universal** Turing machine, which takes as input a *program*. 

    - In this way, the machine can be used to solve any problem for which there is a program. 
    - The program can of course be expressed using a Turing machine.

  - The universal Turing machine is a Turing machine that is capable of reading the "code" of a Turing machine together with its input, and simulate the execution of the machine on this input.

  - Symbols (purest form has just two symbols: `0, 1`). etc.

  - Idea

    - Turing machines can be encoded onto a tape.

    - This allows a TM $U$ to take another TM $A$ as input.

      - $U$ can simulate $A$.

        - Read, write, move left or move right. 

      - $U$ can attempt to establish properties of $A$. 

        > e.g. If it halts or not.
      
      - $U$ is called **Universal Turing Machine**. 

- Encoding Turing Machines

  - We can give a code to each Turing machine.
    - Assume the machine has $n$ states $q_0, . . . , q_{n−1}$, where each $q_i$ is a number, $q_0$ is the initial state, and the last $m$ states are final.
    - Assume the input alphabet is $\{1\}$ and the tape alphabet is $\{0, 1\}$ (0 is the blank symbol). A binary alphabet is sufficient to encode any kind of data.
    - The transition function is represented as a table, or equivalently a list of 5-tuples of the form $(q, s, q', s', d)$, where 
      - $q$ represents the current state, 
      - $s$ the symbol on the tape under the head, 
      - $q'$ the new state, 
      - $s'$ the symbol written on the tape, and 
      - $d$ the direction of movement, which we will write as 0, 1.
    - Full description of the machine: $(n,m,l)$
  - The tuple $(n,m,l)$ is the code for the machine, where
    -  $l$ is the list representing the transition function, 
    - $n$ the number of states, and
    - $m$ the number of final states.
  - The original machine can be recovered from the code.
    - A code is a word, and as such it can be used as input for a Turing machine.
    - It is then possible to define a Turing machine $U$ such that, when the code of a machine $A$ is written on the tape, together with an input word $w$ for $A, U$ decodes it and simulates the behaviour of the machine $A$ on $w$.
    - The machine $U$ is the **universal Turing machine**.

##### 3.1.4. The Power of TM

- Recursively-enumerable Languages
  - TMs are strictly more powerful than PDA.
  - TMs can be associated with Type-0 languages in the Chomsky hierarchy.
  - These are called **recursively-enumerable languages**.
  - However, there are still languages that are not recognisable, even by a TM. Considering the Halting Problem for instance.
- TMs as partial functions
  - TMs implement **partial functions**.
    - They map words to `(word, boolean)` tuples.
  - Since TMs can get caught in continuous loops, it's possible for a TM to not return an output for a given word.
    - Hence why they are only partial functions.
  - A function that can be implemented by a TM is called **Turing computable**.
  - Turing and Church proved all computable functions can be defined in terms of TM.
    - If a function is computable, it is Turing computable. 
- TMs and Imperative Programming
  - TMs are the theoretical basis of imperative programming.
