### 8. Explicit locks

##### 8.1. Reentrancy

- Definition

  - Java synchronized blocks (and methods) are **reentrant**. This means that once a thread has obtained an object’s lock it can enter other synchronized blocks (and methods) on the same object.

    > e.g.
    >
    > Synchronized methods might need to call other synchronized methods. Without the facility for reentrancy, this would not be possible.

    >e.g.
    >
    >```java
    >public class Reentrancy {
    >public synchronized void f() {
    >g(); 
    >}
    >public synchronized void g() { 
    >} 
    >}
    >```
    >
    >> Consider the case in which a thread calls synchronized method `f()` on *object A* and that method `f()` calls synchronized method `g()` also on *object A.* 
    >>
    >> Since the thread has been granted the lock upon entering `f()`, without reentrancy, it would be blocked from entering `g()` until it is granted the lock, which it already holds. 

  - **ReentrantLock** is a basic lock that has the property of **reentrancy**.

- synchronized vs ReentrantLock

  - ReentrantLock

    - Not restricted to a single method as with synchronized, so it **CAN** be locked and unlocked <u>across different methods</u>.

    - Can be made to <u>give access to threads</u> in the order in which they arrive at the critical section.

    - A ReentrantLock also has a wider range of possible acquisition policies. 

      > e.g., It can choose to only acquire the lock if it is immediately available, or available within a certain time period. It can also allow itself to be interrupted whilst waiting to get the lock.

    - A ReentrantLock object can also give information about its ‘waiting list’, etc.

  - synchronized

    - A synchronized block is that the JVM makes no attempt to ensure fairness between the threads competing to enter the block.

##### 8.2. Deadlock

>Issue:
>
>Both intrinsic locks (acquired via synchronized) and explicit locks such as ReentrantLock are convenient ways to create critical sections to protect shared data.
>
>In a realistic application, there will usually be multiple threads trying to acquire multiple locks and, if there are *dependencies* in the locking arrangements, then we could get into problems.

- Definition
  - `Deadlock`
    - A stopping of action because both sides in a struggle are equally powerful and neither will give in
    - Deadlock can occur if the following conditions are all true, 
      1. Mutual Exclusion: i.e. the existence of critical sections.
      2. Hold and Wait: a thread (or process) is currently holding a resource (e.g. a lock) and is seeking to acquire others.
      3. No preemption: a resource (e.g. a lock) is only released when the holding thread releases it.
      4. Circular wait: there exists a cycle of threads or processes waiting on each other for resources.

- Example

  >e.g.
  >
  >```java
  >public class BankAccount {
  >  private double balance;
  >  private int id;
  >  private String name;
  >  public BankAccount(int id, String name, double balance){
  >    this.balance = balance; this.id = id;
  >    this.name = name;
  >  }
  >  void withdraw(double amount){
  >    balance -= amount;
  >    System.out.println("Account " + name + " withdraw.New balance " + balance);
  >  }
  >  void deposit(double amount) {
  >    balance += amount;
  >    System.out.println("Account " + name + " deposit.New balance " + balance);
  >  }
  >  public String getName() {
  >    return name; 
  >  }
  >  public int getId() { 
  >    return id;
  >  } 
  >}
  >
  >public static void main(String [] args) throws InterruptedException {
  >  BankAccount sid = new BankAccount(1,"Sid",10000);
  >  BankAccount doris = new BankAccount(2,"Doris",3000);
  >  Thread thread1 = new Thread("Thread1") {
  >    public void run() {
  >      transfer(sid,doris,200);
  >    } 
  >  };
  >  Thread thread2 = new Thread("Thread2") {
  >    public void run() {
  >      transfer(doris,sid,300);
  >    } 
  >  };  
  >  thread1.start();
  >  thread2.start();
  >}
  >
  >public static void transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, double amount){
  >  synchronized(from){
  >    synchronized(to){
  >      from.withdraw(amount);
  >      to.deposit(amount);
  >    }
  >}
  >```
  >
  >The program creates two bank accounts and then starts two threads that transfer money between the accounts. 
  >
  >The output will be
  >
  >```java
  >Thread1 need to acquire Sid lock.
  >Thread2 need to acquire Doris lock.
  >Thread1 has acquired Sid lock.
  >Thread2 has acquired Doris lock.
  >Thread1 need to acquire Doris lock.
  >Thread2 need to acquire Sid lock.
  >```
  >
  >The threads are **deadlocked** trying to acquire a lock the other thread holds.
  >
  >> The problem is that the two threads call the `transfer()` method with the accounts in a different order. This means that when both threads successfully acquire the ‘from’ lock, the ‘from’ lock is for two different objects. Thus, the locks for “Sid” and “Doris” are now already held by the two threads (one lock each).
  >>
  >> The next thing that the two threads attempt to do is to acquire the ‘to’ lock. But the lock on the ‘to’ objects is already owned by the threads (because both object locks are already owned). Neither can acquire the needed lock so both threads are stuck, hence the deadlock.

- Avoidance

  - Design our code so that deadlock can’t occur. 
  - Use deadlock detection that identify when deadlock has occurred and then break it somehow.

  > ```java

### 9. The dining philosophers problem

##### 9.1. Introduction

- Background

  - A famous example, which is more general than that and can occur whenever shared resources can be locked and multiple threads (or processes) are trying to access them.

  - Details in the following

    >There are <u>5 philosophers</u> sitting at a table. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating. Each thinks for some random period of time until they feel hungry. They then attempt to eat until they are full.
    >
    >Each philosopher <u>requires 2 forks</u> to eat, but there are <u>only 5 forks</u> on the table. As soon as an adjacent fork becomes available, a philosopher will pick it up. They can’t eat until they have two forks though: one in each hand.
    >
    >Philosophers are selfish and greedy and do not coordinate their actions. An eating philosopher will eat until they are ready to stop and think again. They will also immediately grab an available fork, even if they can’t use it yet because it’s the only one they have.

##### 9.2. Analysis

- Pattern - What each philosopher attempts to do is: 
  1. Think for a while.
  2. Pick up the left fork when available.
  3. Pick up the right fork when available. 
  4. Eat until full.
  5. Put down the left fork. 
  6. Put down the right fork. 
  7. goto 1.
- Analysis
  - Since there is no coordination between the philosophers, without intervention this setup could lead to some philosophers eating a lot, some eating a little, some eating nothing or all of them eating nothing.
  - It’s quite possible that, after a period thinking, each philosopher reaches for the left fork at roughly the same time. If this happens then the whole system is deadlocked because no philosopher will be able to pick up their right fork and they will all starve.

##### 9.3. Implementation and Improvement

- Initial Approach

  >e.g.
  >
  >```java
  >// The Fork class is completely empty but it gives us what we need:
  >// an object with an intrinsic lock.
  >// 
  >// Each philosopher receives a reference to two forks in the constructor. 
  >// These are just references to the left-hand and right-hand fork of the philosopher. 
  >//
  >// When a philosopher has managed to get one fork, 
  >// they must wait for the other one to become available before ‘eating’.
  >public Philosopher(Fork f1, Fork f2, int n) {
  >number = n;
  >fork1 = f1;
  >fork2 = f2;
  >
  >// The act() method simply prints out what the philosopher is 
  >	// currently doing and puts the current thread to sleep for a random amount of time.
  >	public void run() {
  >	while (true) {
  >	act("is thinking");
  >	synchronized(fork1) {
  > 	act("has picked up left fork.");
  > 	synchronized(fork2) {
  >   	act("has picked up right fork.");
  >   	act("is eating.");
  > 	}
  >	} 
  >	}
  >	}
  >}
  >
  >
  >// Main program that creates the five philosophers and forks, 
  >// allocates forks to philosophers and then starts each philosopher thread.
  >public class DiningPhilosophers {
  >private static final int SIZE = 5;
  >private static Fork[] forks = new Fork[SIZE];
  >private static Philosopher[] philosophers = new Philosopher[SIZE];
  >public static void main(String[] args) {
  >for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
  > forks[i] = new Fork();
  >}
  >for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
  > philosophers[i] = new Philosopher(forks[i], forks[(i + 1) % forks.length], i+1);
  >}
  >for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
  > new Thread(philosophers[i]).start();
  >}
  >} 
  >}
  >
  >```
  >
  >The output:
  >
  >```java
  >Philosopher 2 is thinking
  >Philosopher 3 is thinking
  >Philosopher 1 is thinking
  >Philosopher 4 is thinking
  >Philosopher 5 is thinking
  >Philosopher 5 has picked up left fork.
  >Philosopher 4 has picked up left fork.
  >Philosopher 1 has picked up left fork.
  >Philosopher 2 has picked up left fork.
  >Philosopher 3 has picked up left fork.
  >```
  >
  >The philosophers are deadlocked and will starve and never think again.
  >
  >>It is possible to run the program for a long time without deadlock. However this can’t be guaranteed at all.
  >>
  >>We can create an easy solution to this problem by reordering the forks. If all of the philosophers attempt to pick up their left fork, as usual, except the final one who picks up their right fork, we avoid the deadlock.
  >>
  >>This works because the previous version contains a circular wait condition in which the philosophers are all waiting on the philosopher to the right of them.

- Fixed Approach

  >e.g.
  >
  >```java
  >public class DiningPhilosophersFixed {
  >       private static final int SIZE = 5;
  >       private static Fork[] forks = new Fork[SIZE];
  >       private static Philosopher[] philosophers = new
  >           Philosopher[SIZE];
  >       public static void main(String[] args) {
  >          for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
  >            forks[i] = new Fork();
  >          }
  >          for (int i = 0; i < SIZE-1; i++) {
  >            philosophers[i] = new Philosopher(forks[i],
  >                forks[(i + 1) % forks.length], i+1);
  >          }
  >          philosophers[SIZE-1] = new Philosopher(forks[(SIZE)
  >              % forks.length], forks[SIZE-1], SIZE);
  >          for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
  >            new Thread(philosophers[i]).start();
  >          }
  >} 
  >}
  >```
  >
  >Partial output:
  >
  >```java
  >    Philosopher 3 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 5 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 4 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 1 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 2 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 5 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 4 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 2 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 3 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 4 has picked up right fork.
  >    Philosopher 4 is eating.
  >    Philosopher 3 has picked up right fork.
  >    Philosopher 4 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 5 has picked up right fork.
  >    Philosopher 3 is eating.
  >    Philosopher 5 is eating.
  >    Philosopher 1 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 5 is thinking
  >    Philosopher 4 has picked up left fork.
  >    Philosopher 3 is thinking
  >```
  >
  >>This fix does work in this case but we can also find solutions that use concurrency constructs.
  >>
  >>We saw earlier that we can create Lock objects that give us some more flexibility than the synchronized block. We can make use of that additional flexibility with the dining philosophers problem.

- Using ReentrantLock

  >}

  >fork1 = f1;
  >fork2 = f2;
  >
  >  
  >  public void run() {
  >    while (!quit) {
  >      act("is thinking");
  >      thinkingCount++;
  >      if (fork1.pickUp()) {
  >        announce("has picked up left fork.");
  >        if (fork2.pickUp()) {
  >          announce("has picked up right fork.");
  >          act("is eating");
  >          eatingCount++;
  >          fork1.putDown();
  >          fork2.putDown();
  >        }
  >        else {
  >          fork1.putDown();
  >        } 
  >      }
  >    } 
  >  }
  >}
  >
  >```
  >
  >The output:
  >
  >```java
  >Philosopher 1 thought 22 times and ate 5 times.
  >Philosopher 2 thought 22 times and ate 4 times.
  >Philosopher 3 thought 27 times and ate 5 times.
  >Philosopher 4 thought 27 times and ate 7 times.
  >Philosopher 5 thought 32 times and ate 4 times.
  >
  >```
  >
  >>We don’t expect the output to be exactly the same for each philosopher but for all philosophers to have thought and eaten. The increased flexibility of ReentrantLock allowed that.

### 10. Semaphores

##### 10.1. Semaphore

- Definition
  - `semaphore`
    - Basically just an integer variable, that is limited to a fixed maximum value, with some methods to increase and decrease the value of the variable.
    - A semaphore is initialised to its maximum value, *e.g. 5 as in the example above.* 
      - In the terminology of the Java SDK, this means that the semaphore has 5 reusable ‘permits’ available. 
      - When a permit is requested, it is granted and the number of available permits is reduced to 4 (in this example). 
      - When another is requested, the number is reduced to 3, and so on. When the number of available permits reaches zero, no more can be granted.
  - `counting semaphore`
    - When a process or thread, etc. has finished with the resource protected by the semaphore, then it returns the permit. If the number of available permits is zero, and one is returned, there is clearly now one available permit. 
    - The number of available permits never exceeds the maximum.
  - `binary semaphore`. 
    - A binary semaphore can <u>only hold the values 0 and 1</u>. 
    - A binary semaphore <u>**CAN** be used as a lock</u>.
- Background
  - So far we have considered cases in which access to a resource (e.g. contained in a critical section) was permitted for only one thread at a time.
  - It can be the case that multiple threads (or processes) can be allowed to access a resource simultaneously. As we have seen, this is not suitable when accessing the shared resource (e.g. shared object) causes the program to behave incorrectly due to thread (or process) interference. But there are other cases when this might be appropriate.
  - Consider a scenario in which an application has a DBMS on the server side. The DBMS may only support a fixed number of concurrent connections, for example 5 connections. In the case where there are more users than allowable connections, access to the connections must be restricted.
  - So, we want to restrict access to this resource but not to one thread at a time but 5, in this example.
  - We still have to consider the effects of concurrent access but, in this case, the DBMS will manage that.

##### 10.2. Example

- Database Connection example

  >e.g.
  >
  >```java
  >public class DatabaseConnection {
  >       private static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5;
  >       private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(MAX_CONNECTIONS);
  >       public boolean connect() {
  >          boolean success = false;
  >          try {
  >            success = semaphore.tryAcquire(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
  >          } catch (InterruptedException e) {
  >            e.printStackTrace();
  >            return success;
  >          }
  >          return success;
  >       }
  >       public void disconnect() {
  >          semaphore.release();
  >       }
  >       public int getNumPermitsAvailable() {
  >          return semaphore.availablePermits();
  >       }
  >}
  >```
  >
  >> We can see that this database connection class has a semaphore that limits the number of permits to 5.
  >>
  >> In the connect() method, which will be used by any thread trying to connect to the database, we see the use of the Semaphore.tryAcquire() method. This version of the method allows an attempt to last for a certain time period. In this example, that is 100 milliseconds.
  >>
  >> We also see the disconnect() method which simply returns the permit.
