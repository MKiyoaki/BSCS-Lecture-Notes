### 3.1. Substitution ciphers

##### 3.1.1. Introduction to Substitution Ciphers

- Definition
  - A **substitution cipher** is one in which the letters of plaintext are replaced by other letters or by numbers or symbols.
  - If the plaintext is viewed as a sequence of bits, then substitution involves replacing plaintext bit patterns with ciphertext bit patterns.

- Examples

  - Caesar cipher

    > e.g.
    >
    > `KHOOR ZRUOG = HELLO WORLD`
    >
    > Each plaintext character is replaced by character 3 to the right modulo 26. 

  - ROT13

    > e.g.
    >
    > `Jnf vg n pne be n png V fnj ? = Was it a car or a cat I saw ?`
    >
    > Shift each letter by 13 places. Under Unix-like systems: `tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M`. 

  - Alphanumeric

    > e.g.
    >
    > `1-24-4 1-24-4 = BYE BYE`
    >
    > Substitute numbers for letters.


##### 3.1.2. Caeser Cipher

- Introduction

  - Earliest known, simple, substitution cipher, used by Julius Caesar. 

  - Implemented by cipher disks to encrypt a letter with the third letter to the right, <u>i.e., replace each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing 3 places further down the alphabet (wrapping around)</u>. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```
    > plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
    > cipher: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
    > ```
    >
    >  Note that the alphabet is wrapped around, so that the letter following Z is A.
    >
    > ```
    > plain:  meet me after the toga party
    > cipher: PHHW PH DIWHU WKH WRJD SDUWB
    > ```

- Mechanism

  - Mathematically, give each letter a number mapping, 
    $\begin{matrix} a \mapsto 1 \\ b \mapsto 1 \\ ... \\ z \mapsto 25\end{matrix} $
  - In general, for $K \in \{1, 2, ..., 25\}$
    $$
    C = E(K, P) = (P + K) \mod 26 \\
    P = E(K, C) = (C - K) \mod 26 \\
    $$

  - We count modulo 26 because from 0 to 25 there are 26 numbers (0, 1, 2, ... 25), so we can only count up to 25 and when we reach 26, we start again from 0.

- Cryptanalysis

  - Three important characteristics of this problem <u>enabled us to use a brute-force cryptanalysis</u>:
    1. The encryption and decryption algorithms are known.
    2. There are only 25 keys to try.
    3. The language of the plaintext is known and easily recognizable.
  - Makes brute-force cryptanalysis impractical
    - Use of an algorithm that employs <u>a large number of keys</u>. 

      > e.g.
      >
      > triple DES algorithm makes use of a 168-bit key, giving a key space of $2168 (> 3.7 \times 10^{50})$ possible keys.
    - If language of plaintext is unknown, then output may not be recognizable. 
    - There could also be two possible sensible plaintexts in two different languages, 

      > e.g.
      >
      > The ciphertext `AMBC` can be decrypted to the English plaintext CODE (with key 24) or to the Sanskrit SETU, which means `bridge` in English (with key 8). 

- History


##### 3.1.3. Mono-alphabetic Substitution Ciphers

- Introduction

  - Generalise Caesar cipher by allowing an arbitrary substitution.

- Mechanism

  - *Permutation* of a finite set $S$ of elements: an ordered sequence of all elements of $S$, each element appearing exactly once.

    > e.g.
    >
    > 6 permutations of $S = \{a, b, c\}: \text{abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba}$

  - In general: $n!$ permutations of a set of $n$ elements. 
  - If the cipher line of a Caesar cipher can be any permutation of the 26 alphabetic characters, then there are $26! (> 4 \times 10^{26})$ possible keys.
  
  > i.e.
  >
  > Such an approach is referred to as a **mono-alphabetic substitution cipher**, because a single cipher alphabet (mapping from plain alphabet to cipher alphabet) is used per message.
  
- Definition

  - Let $\mathcal{K}$ be the set of all permutations on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. Define for each $e \in \mathcal{K}$ an encryption transformation $E_e$ on strings $m = m_1m_2...m_n \in \mathcal{M}$ as
    $$
    E_e(m) = e(m_1)e(m_2)...e(m_n) = c_1c_2...c_n = c
    $$
  - To decrypt $c$, compute the inverse permutation $d = e^{-1}$ and 
    $$
    D_d(c) = d(c_1)d(c_2)...d(c_n) = m
    $$
  - $E_e$ is a **mono-alphabetic substitution cipher**.
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > ```
    > Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    > Cipher: DKVQFIBJWPESCXHTMYAUOLRGZN
    > ```
    >
    > ```
    > Plaintext: IFWEWISHTOREPLACELETTERS
    > Ciphertext: WIRFRWAJUHYFTSDVFSFUUFYA
    > ```

##### 3.1.4. Cryptoanalysis: (In)security of substitution ciphers

- Key spaces are typically huge.

  26 letters ⇒ $26! = 4 \times 1026$ possible keys.

- This is not secure since, 

  - Easy to crack using frequency analysis (letters, digram, etc.).
  - Frequencies for English of different letters are imbalanced. 

- Easy to apply, except for short, atypical texts, e.g.,

  - *From Zanzibar to Zambia and Zaire, ozone zones make zebras run zany zigzags.*
  - More sophistication required to mask statistical regularities.


- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > Given ciphertext:
  >
  > ```
  > UZQSOVUOHXMOPVGPOZPEVSGZWSZOPFPESXUDBMETSXAIZ
  > VUEPHZHMDZSHZOWSFPAPPDTSVPQUZWYMXUZUHSX
  > EPYEPOPDZSZUFPOMBZWPFUPZHMDJUDTMOHMQ
  > ```
  >
  > - Count relative letter frequencies.
  > - Since `P` and `Z` occur most frequently, guess they correspond to `E` and `T` respectively.
  > - Count relative **digram** (a sequence of 2 letters, a.k.a. **digraph**) frequencies.
  > - Since `ZW` occurs most frequently, guess it corresponds to `TH` (which is the digram occurring most frequently in English).
  > - Hence `ZWP` is `THE`.
  > - By proceeding with trial and error finally get the plaintext. 
  >
  > ```
  > IT WAS DISCLOSED YESTERDAY THAT SEVERAL INFORMAL BUT DIRECT
  > CONTACTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
  > VIET CONG IN MOSCOW
  > ```

##### 3.1.5. Cryptanalysis: a little bit of history

> - The Abbasid caliphate (or dynasty), started in 750 AC, heralded golden age of Islamic civilisation (arts and sciences flourished).
> - A wealthy and peaceful society, which relied on an effective system of administration, and in turn the administrators relied on secure communication achieved through the use of encryption.
>   - Many administrative manuals, such as the tenth-century Adab al-Kuttab, include sections devoted to cryptography, mainly monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.
> - Invention of **cryptanalysis** required scholarship in many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, linguistics and religion:
>   - Theologians established the chronology of Muhammad’s revelations in the Quran by counting the **frequencies** of words contained in each revelation and considering that certain words had evolved relatively recently.
>   - They also analysed individual letters, and in particular they discovered that some letters are more common than others (e.g., a and l are the most common in Arabic).

### 3.2. Typical Substitution Ciphers

##### 3.2.1. Homophonic Ciphers

- Motivation

  - Mono-alphabetic ciphers are easy to break because they reflect the frequency data of the original alphabet.
  - Countermeasure: provide multiple substitutes (i.e., *homophones*) for a single letter to make frequency analysis more difficult. 

- Defintion

  - To each $a \in \mathcal{A}$ associate a set $H(a)$ of strings of $t$ symbols, where $H(a), a \in \mathcal{A}$ are pairwise disjoint.
  - Replace each $a$ with a randomly chosen string from $H(a)$.
  - To decrypt a string $c$ of $t$ symbols, one must determine an $a \in A$ such that $c \in H(a)$.
  - The key for the cipher is the sets $H(a)$. 

- Example
	> e.g.
	> $\mathcal{A} = \{x, y\}, H(x) = \{00, 10\}, H(y) = \{01, 11\}$.
	>
	> The plaintext $xy$ encrypts to one of: $0001, 0011, 1001, 1011$. 
	
- Security

  - Cost - data expansion and more work for decryption.
  - Cryptanalysis relatively **easy** even with homophones, since
    - each element of plaintext affects only one element of ciphertext,
    - multiple-letter patterns (e.g., digram frequencies) still survive in the ciphertext.
  - Two principal methods used in substitution ciphers to lessen the extent to which the structure of plaintext survives in ciphertext:
    1. Encrypt multiple letters of plaintext, e.g., the **Playfair cipher** (or the **Hill cipher**, which we will not discuss here)
    2. Use multiple cipher alphabets (polyalphabetic substitution), e.g., **Vigenère cipher**


##### 3.2.2. Playfair Ciphers

- Motivation

  - Uses a **5 × 5 matrix of letters** constructed using a keyword.

    > e.g.
    >
    > | **M** | **O** | **N** | **A** | **R** |
    > | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
    > | **C** | **H** | **Y** | B     | D     |
    > | E     | F     | G     | I/J   | K     |
    > | L     | P     | Q     | S     | T     |
    > | U     | V     | W     | X     | Z     |
    >
    > - Pick keyword, here is `monarchy`.
    > - Construct matrix: 
    >   - fill in letter so fkeyword (minusduplicates) left2right & top2bottom, and remaining letters in alphabetic order, where I and J count as one letter.
    > - Plain text is encrypted two letters at a time:
    >   1. If a pair is a repeated letter, insert filler like `X` (e.g., `BALLOON` -> `BA LX LO ON`). Add an `X` also at the end if needed (or any other character, like the `A` in this example). 
    >   2. If both letters fall in the same row, replace each with letter to right, wrapping back to start from end. (e.g., `AR` is encrypted as `RM`. )
    >   3. If both letters fall in the same column, replace each with the letter below it, wrapping to top from bottom. (e.g., `MU` is encrypted as `CM`. )
    >   4. Otherwise each letter is replaced by the letter in the same row and in the column of the other letter of the pair. (e.g., `HS` becomes `BP` and `EA` becomes `IM`, or `JM`, as encipherer wishes. )

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```
    > Plaintext         : THEQUICKBROWNFOXIUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG 
    > Plaintextformatted: THEQUICKBROWNFOXIUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOGA 
    > Ciphertext        : PDGLXEDEDANVOGAVEXOLPAUFDZCFSMWDHRIN
    > ```
    >
    > To decrypt, use the inverse (opposite) of rules 2 and 3, and the 1st as-is (dropping any extra `X`s that do not make sense in the final message when finished) and the 4th as-is.

- Security

  - Security much improved over monoalphabetic: $26 × 26 = 676$ digrams vs. $26$ letters.
  - Would need a 676 entry frequency table to analyse, and correspondingly more ciphertext.

    > Invented in 1854 by British scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone, but it bears the name of his friend Baron Playfair of St. Andrews, who championed the cipher at the British foreign office).
    >
    > Playfair cipher was for a long time considered unbreakable. It used as the standard field system by British Army in WWI and still partly used by U.S. Army and other Allied forces during WWII.
  
  - However, breaking it is relatively easy since,
    - still leaves much of the structure of the plaintext language intact
    - a few hundred letters of ciphertext are generally sufficient

##### 3.2.3. Vigenère Cipher

- Polyalphabetic Substitution Ciphers

  - Use different monoalphabetic substitutions as one proceeds through the plaintext message.
  - Two general features common to all such ciphers:
    1. A set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules is used. 
    2. A key determines which particular rule is chosen for a given transformation.

- Introduction to Vigenère cipher

  - Best known, and perhaps simplest polyalphabetic Substitution Ciphers. 
  - Introduced by Blaise de Vigenère, from court of Henry III of France (16th century).
    - Set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules consists of the 26 Caesar ciphers with shifts of 0 through 25.
    - Each cipher is denoted by a key letter, which is the ciphertext letter that substitutes for the plaintext letter `A`.
    - Thus, a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is denoted by key value `D`.
  - Needs <u>a key as long as message</u> (usually: a repeating keyword).

- Definition

  - Assume

    - A sequence of plaintext letters $P = p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}$
    - A key consisting of the sequence of letters $K = k_0, k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m-1}$
    - Typically $m<n$

  - Sequence of ciphertext letters $C = C_0, C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n-1}$
    $$
    \begin{array}{lll}
    C &= &C_0, C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n-1} \\
    ~ &= &E(K, P) \\
    ~ &= &E((p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}), (k_0, k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m-1})) \\
    ~ &= &(p_0 +k_0) \mod 26, (p_1 +k_1) \mod 26, ..., (p_m + k_0) \mod 26, (p_{m+1} + k_1) \mod 26, ... \\
    C_i &= &(p_i+k_{i \mod m}) \mod 26
    
    \end{array}
    $$

    - First letter of the key is added to first letter of plaintext, mod 26, second letters are added, and so on through the first *m* letters of plaintext.
    - For next $m$ letters of the plaintext, the key letters are repeated.
    - Process continues until all of plaintext sequence is encrypted.

  - Decryption
    $$
    p_i = (C_i - k_{i \mod m}) \mod 26
    $$

- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > if the keyword is `deceptive`, the message `we are discovered save your self` is encrypted as
  >
  > ```
  > key       : deceptivedeceptivedeceptive
  > plaintext : wearediscoveredsaveyourself
  > ciphertext: ZICVTWQNGRZGVTWAVZHCQYGLMGJ
  > ```

- Security

  - Strength: multiple The strength of this cipher is that there are multiple ciphertext letters for each laintext letter, one for each unique letter of the keyword. Thus, the letter frequency is obscured. 
  - However, ot all knowledge of the plaintext structure is lost.
    - Better than Playfair, but considerable frequency info remains.
  - Aids for en/de-cryption with polyalphabetic ciphers
    - Implementing polyalphabetic ciphers by hand can be very tedious.
    - Various aids were devised to assist the process, e.g., **Saint-Cyr Slide** is a simple manual aid:
      - a slide with repeated alphabet,
      - line up plaintext `A` with key letter, e.g., `C`, 
      - then read off any mapping for key letter.
    - Can bend round into a cipher disk or expand into a Vigenère Tableau.

- Kasiski Method

  - For some centuries the Vigenère cipher was le *chiffre indéchiffrable* (the unbreakable cipher).
  
    > Broken by Charles Babbage ("inventor" of the computer) in 1854 but kept secret (possibly because of the Crimean War).
  - Method independently reinvented by Friedrich Kasiski
  
    - repetitions in ciphertext give clues to period
    - so find same plaintext an exact period apart which results in the same ciphertext
    - of course, could also be random fluke
  
      > e.g.
      >
      > repeated `VTW` in previous example
  
    - suggests size of 3 or 9
    - then attack each monoalphabetic cipher individually using same techniques as before

- Zimmermann telegram

  > However, lack of major advances meant that various polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were used into the 20th century.
  >
  > One very famous incident was the breaking of the Zimmermann telegram in WWI which resulted in the USA entering the war.
  >
  > A 1917 diplomatic proposal from the German Empire for Mexico to join in alliance if USA entered WWI against Germany. Intercepted and decoded by British cryptographers of Room 40.

##### 3.2.4. Vernam Cipher

- Motivation

  > Gilbert Vernam (AT&T engineer, 1918) proposed a system where keyword is as long as plaintext and has no statistical relationship to it. 

  - It works on binary data (bits) rather than letters, using **XOR** $⊕$:
    $$
    0 ⊕ 0 = 0 \\
    0 ⊕ 1 = 1 \\
    1 ⊕ 0 = 1 \\
    1 ⊕ 1 = 1
    $$
    so that
    $$
    \begin{array}{lll}
    a ⊕ a &= &0 \\
    a ⊕ 0 &= &a \\
    a ⊕ b &= &b ⊕ a \\
    a ⊕ b ⊕ b &= &a \\
    (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c &= &a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)
    \end{array}
    $$
    
  - XOR can be used as polyalphabetic cipher:
    $$
    P ⊕ K = C \\
    C ⊕ K = P
    $$
  
  - Idea
    $$
    c_i = p_i ⊕ k_i \\ 
    p_i = c_ i ⊕ k_i
    $$
  
    - $p_i/ c_i/ k_i = i_{th}$ **binary digit** of plaintext /ciphertext /key.
    - Encryption
      - Ciphertext generated by bitwise XOR of plaintext and key.
    - Decryption
      - Simply same bitwise operation (by properties of XOR). 
    - Essence of this cipher: means of construction of the key.
    - Vernam proposed <u>use of a running loop of tape</u> that eventually repeated the key (hence: very long but repeating keyword).
    - Difficult to break if key is long, but still breakable with sufficient ciphertext, use of known or probable plaintext sequences, or both.
    
  - Example
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > Mr X wants to be able to send his message over a **public** network.
    >
    > In order to protect their interests, Mr X and his broker decide to encrypt the message that will convey the decision.
    >
    > Since a substitution cipher would be easy to break with such a short (and predictable) message, they decide to use a system with two keys, $K_1$ and $K_2$ are **equally likely**.
    >
    > - $K_1$ encrypts `buy` to 0 and `sell` to 1:
    >
    >   $E_{K_1} (\texttt{buy}) = 0$ and $E_{K_1} (\texttt{sell}) = 1$.
    >
    > - $K_1$ encrypts `buy` to 1 and `sell` to 0:
    >
    >   $E_{K_2} (\texttt{buy}) = 1$ and $E_{K_2} (\texttt{sell}) = 0$.
    >
    > - If the attacker intercepts a 0, then all that he can deduce is that the message might be `sell` if $K_2$ was used, or `buy` if $K_1$ was used.
    >
    > - Since each key is equally likely, the attacker is forced to guess which key was used: the chances of guessing correctly are 50%.
  
- Perfect secrecy - In essence

  - Before the ciphertext was intercepted, the attacker's only option was to try to guess the message.
  - Once the ciphertext was intercepted, the attacker could also guess the key.
  - Since the number of keys is the same as the number of messages, the chances of either guess being correct are equal.

##### 3.2.5. One-time Pad

- Motivation

  - Basing on Verman Cipher, use a truly **random key** that is
    - as long as the message, so that the key need not be repeated,
    - used to encrypt and decrypt a single message, and then discarded.
  - Each new message $P$ requires a new key of <u>same length</u> as $P$.
  - Produces random output with no statistical relation to plaintext.
  - Unbreakable: $C$ contains no information whatsoever about $P$. Only cryptosystem that exhibits so-called *perfect secrecy*.
- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > Exhaustive search of all possible keys yields many legible plaintexts, with no way of knowing which was the intended one,
  >
  > Suppose a cryptanalyst managed to find these two keys.
  >
  > - Two plausible plaintexts are produced.
  > - Which is the correct decryption (i.e., which is the correct key)?
  >
  > If the actual key were produced in a truly random fashion, then cryptanalyst cannot say that one key is more likely than the other.
  >
  > Given any $P$ of equal length to $C$, there is $K$ that produces that $P$.
  >
  > > No patterns or regularities: if stream of characters that constitute $K$ is truly random, then so will be stream of characters that constitute $C$.
- Practical difficulties

  - Two fundamental practical difficulties
    - Making large quantities of random keys.
    - Key distribution and protection, where for every message to be sent, a key of equal length is needed by both sender and receiver.
  - Solution
    - Limited utility
    - Useful primarily for low-bandwidth channels requiring very high security (Moscow–Washington communication previously secured this way).

### 3.3. Transposition Ciphers

##### 3.3.1. Transposition Ciphers

- Definition

  - Perform some sort of permutation on the plaintext letters. Works on blocks of letters of the plaintext. i.e., The letters in the plaintext also occur in the ciphertext, but in different order.
  - Formally,
    - For block length $t$, let $\mathcal{K}$ be the set of permutations on $\{1, . . . , t\}$. For each $e \in \mathcal{K}$ and $m \in \mathcal{M}$,
      $$
      E_e(m) = E_{e(1)}E_{e(2)}...E_{e(t)}
      $$
    - The set of all such transformations is called a **transposition cipher**.
  - Decryption
    - To decrypt $c = c_1 c_2 ... c_t$ compute $D_d(c) = c_{d(1)} c_{d(2)} ... c_{d(t)}$, where $d$ is inverse permutation. 
    - Letters unchanged so one can exploit frequency analysis for dipthongs, tripthongs, words, etc.

##### 3.3.2. Rail Fence Cipher

- Motivation

  - Plaintext is written down as a sequence of diagonals and then read off as a sequence of rows. 

    > Beware: variants exist under the same name.

- Process

  - Decryption - Reconstruct the diagonal grid used to encrypt the message.
    - Start by making a grid with as many rows as the key is, and as many columns as the length of the ciphertext.
    - Place the first letter in the top left square, and dashes diagonally downwards where the letters will be
    - When we get back to the top row, we place the next letter in the ciphertext.
    - Continue like this across the row, and start the next row when you reach the end.

- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > To encipher the message 
  >
  > ```
  > MEET ME AFTER THE TOGA PARTY
  > ```
  >
  > with a rail fence of depth 2, we write:
  >
  > ```
  > M E M A T R H T G P R Y 
  >   E T E F E T E O A A T
  > ```
  >
  > So that the ciphertext is
  >
  > ```
  > MEMATRHTGPRY ETEFETEOAAT
  > ```
  >

  > e.g.
  >
  > Decrypt the message that encrypted with a key of 4, <u>we have a table with 4 rows because the key is 4</u>, and 28 columns as the ciphertext has length 28.
  >
  > ```
  > TEKOOHRACIRMNREATANFTETYTGHH
  > ```
  >
  > We start by placing the `T` in the first square, and then dash the diagonal down spaces until we get back to the top row, and place the `E` here. Continuing to fill the top row we get:

  >  -   - -   - -   - -   - - 
  >   - -   - -   - -   - -   -
  >    -     -     -     -     -
  > ```
  >
  > Turn by turn we can get the full message

##### 3.3.3. Rotating (turning) grilles

- Motivation
  > Cardano grille: Girolamo Cardano (Italy, 16th cent., mathematician and Kabbalist).

  - Use a mask (grille) with precut holes.
    - Encoder writes plaintext in holes, removes mask, fills remainder with blind text, retaining appearance of an innocuous message.
    - Decryption: recipient must possess an identical mask (or must know spacing that created it).
  - Skipping letters within an otherwise plausible ciphertext.
  - Is example of steganography, but provides basis for transposition.

- **Grille** - a sheet with a grid of squares, some of which are cut out.

- Prepare the Grille

  - When enciphering, every time the grille is turned, the cut out squares are precisely positioned at squares not yet filled. 
  - Procedure to select squares of the grille to be cut out:
    - divide grid in 3 × 3 quadrants, number squares of each quadrant,
    - among four squares numbered `1`, select one to be cut out (e.g., rightmost square of top row) to ensure that each of these four squares is exposed exactly once during enciphering,
    - among four squares numbered `2`, one is selected to be cut out...
  - By choosing thus exactly one square to be cut out from among the four squares bearing the same number, it can be ensured that each square can be filled at one of the four rotating positions.

  - Other, more complex, grilles exist as well.

##### 3.3.4. Multiple-stage Columnar Transposition Cipher

- Process

  - Write message in a rectangle, row by row, and read message off, column by column, but *permute the order of the columns*.
  - The order of the columns thus is the key to the algorithm.

    > e.g.
    >
    > With key `4312567` (and with padding to fill the grid)
    >
    > ```
    > Key       : 4 3 1 2 5 6 7
    > Plaintext : a t t a c k p
    > 						o s t p o n e
    > 						d u n t i l t
    > 						w o a m x y z
    > Ciphertext: TTNAAPTMTSUOAODWCOIXKNLYPETZ
    > ```
    >
    > To encrypt, start with column labeled 1, write down all letters in that column, proceed with column labeled 2, etc.
    >
    > A pure transposition cipher is easily recognized and attacked: ciphertext has <u>same letter frequencies</u> as original plaintext.
  
  - A pure transposition cipher is easily recognized and attacked: ciphertext has same letter frequencies as original plaintext.
  - A transposition cipher (columnar or not) can be made significantly more secure by **performing more than one stage of transposition**.
  - Result: more complex permutation that is not easily reconstructed.

- Security

  - Multiple stages of encryption can produce an algorithm that is significantly more difficult to cryptanalyze
  - This is as true of substitution ciphers as it is of transposition ciphers.
