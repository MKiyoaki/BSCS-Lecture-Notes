  performance

- Closing - <u>finalizing</u> all project activities and completing deliverables

---

#### 2. Project Constraints

###### 2.1. Definition

- `Project Constraints` 
  - A limitation or restriction that hinders the flexibility of a project. 
  - Can arise from various factors, *including project scope budget, time, resources, quality, and risk*. 

###### 2.2. Recognition

- Recognizing factors that define the parameters within which a project must operate
  - Affecting its scope, 
  - schedule, 
  - budget, 
  - or quality

###### 2.3. Models of project constraints

- Iron Triangle 

  - Components - Time, cost, scope.

  - Concept

    - <u>Changing one element affects the others</u>, demonstrating the interdependence of constraints, with a delicate balance between them
    - The three factors affects the final quality

- Diamond Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, and quality.
  - Concept
    - Quality is added as a core constraint, emphasizing its importance in project management.
    - Recognizes that <u>a project may fail</u> despite meeting time and cost constraints if it lacks quality.

- PMBOK Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and stakeholders.
  - Concept
    - Includes a broader set of constraints, incorporating stakeholders and risk as crucial elements.
    - Acknowledges that project success is influenced by a broader set of factors beyond the traditional three constraints.

###### 2.4. Types of project constraints

> Different constraints are interconnected; altering one may affect others. 
>
> For example, increasing scope might impact cost and time

- **Cost/Budget Constraint** - Limitation on the <u>financial resources</u> available.
- **Time/Schedule Constraint** - Restrictions on the project's <u>timeline</u>.
- **Scope Constraint** - <u>Boundaries</u> defining what is and isn't part of the project.
- **Quality Constraint** - The standard of deliverables and project outcomes.

- Impact
  - Lack of **formal authority** can lead to
    - unclear responsibilities, 
    - stalled progress, 
    - unmanaged risks, and 
    - scope creep.

- Benefits

  - Help build informal authority by 

    establishing the project manager as a credible, respectful, and accountable leader who is constantly present and communicating with the team.

- Applying the Four Foundational Behaviors

  - To apply these behaviors in practical situations, a **project manager** should
    1. communicate with conviction and integrity, 
    2. use appropriate language,

---

#### 14. Development testing

###### 14.1. Definition

- Phase - Performed during construction phase of lifecycle
  - Software testing that takes place as software is being developed

###### 14.2. Techniques

- Unit tests - **Tests single component** of the software in isolation

  - <u>Most efficient type</u> of test when only testing small chunk of code - pinpoints the cause directly
  - Software isn‚Äôt tested solely by unit testing as real software is not a connection of independent units, and units depend on one another

- Integration testing - Run tests on **multiple combined units**, when there are dependencies between units

  >e.g. 
  >
  >A function A might call a function B so that function A is dependent on function B. The easiest way to write tests of function A involves testing both functions together, by calling A for a range of inputs and comparing actual outputs with expectations. In other words, we would be testing functions A and B together.

  - Alternatively, test the interface between units, *e.g., a function makes calls on a web service to retrieve data*

- Mocking

  - Software testing technique where fake objects simulate the behaviour of real components, *such as using a web service to retrieve data*

- User interface testing - tests the entire system, unless certain components are mocked

  - Use automated tests to prescribe by means of examples how you want your source code to behave. In other words, start by treating automated tests as a form of software specifications
  - Tools automate what a human tester would do when they run the application and interact with it through its UI

- Partition testing - Partition the space of possible inputs and outputs into meaningfully distant categories

  - Can then define a set of test cases to ensure all sets in the partition are covered by test cases
  - Blackbox testing - absence of knowledge of source code

- Coverage testing - How much of your source code is run or touched during the execution of a test suite

  - Proportion of program statements covered by testing (python ‚Üí each line = a program statement)
  - Types 
    - branch coverage(proportion of all branches covered), 
    - loop coverage(proportion of iterations that have been executed 0 times, 1 time, multiple times), 
    - condition coverage(looks at condition statements), 
    - path coverage(proportion of possible paths through the code that have been executed)

---

#### 15. Clean code

- `Technical debt` - Reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy approach instead of using a better approach that would take longer
- `Clean code` - reduce technical debt, stand test of time

###### 15.2. Techniques

- Choose suitable names

  - Intention revealing names - choose a word with meaning
  - Avoid generic names, don‚Äôt make names too long or short
  - Use names that can be pronounced easily, use concepts consistently

- Comments

  - Don‚Äôt comment obvious code
  - Update comments when needed

- Clean functions

  - Do just one thing, use one level of abstraction

  - **Stepdown rule** - read through program as through it was a set of paragraphs

  - Command query separation ‚Äì functions <u>do something or answer something</u>, not both

  - DRY - Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself, 

    WET - Write Everything Twice

  - Limit args on a function where possible
