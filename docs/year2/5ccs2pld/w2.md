### 5. Imperative Languages

##### 5.1. Definition

- Terminology

  - `Imperative languages` 
    - A programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state.
    - Abstractions of the underlying <u>Von Neumann computer architecture</u>.
      - One of the main components of the computer is its **memory**, storing instructions and data. In imperative languages, variables represent **memory cells**.
      - Related concepts - the **properties of variables** and the **flow of control among instructions**.
  - `variables` - an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of data or object referred to as a value

- Variable

  - **Name** - usually a string of characters with some constraints *(e.g. maximal length, etc)*.

  - **Type** - indicates <u>the range of values</u> that are allowed as well as the operations that are available. Some languages are untyped, others are **statically typed** *(e.g., Java, Haskell, ML, Scala)* or **dynamically typed** *(e.g., Python, Ruby)*.

  - **Address** - The memory address to which the variable is associated (also called l-value).

    - This association is not simple as the same name may be associated with different addresses in different parts of the program. 
    - In some languages it is possible to associate more than one name with the same address *(e.g. variant records in Pascal, EQUIVALENCE statement in Fortran)*.

  - **Value** - the contents of the memory associated with the variable (also called *r-value*).

  - **Lifetime** - the time during which the variable is allocated a specific memory location (between allocation and deallocation). There are <u>four types of variables</u> according to their lifetime.

  - **Scope** - the range of instructions in which the variable is visible (can be used).

    - **Static Scope** - can be determined before the execution of the program (at compile time).

      - When a variable is referenced, the compiler looks for its declaration in the same block and if there is no declaration then looks in the parent block, etc.
      - If no declaration is found then the compiler detects an error.

    - **Dynamic Scope** - depends on the calling sequence of subprograms instead of their declaration. 

      - Problems: it is not possible to do static type-checking, programs are very difficult to understand.

      > e.g. Static Scope in Pascal
      >
      > ```pascal
      > program main;
      > var x :  real;
      > procedure P1;
      > var x :  integer;		// local variable
      > begin
      > ...  x ...
      > end;
      > procedure P2;
      > begin
      > ...  x ...					// global variable
      > end;
      > begin main
      > ...  x ...					// global variable
      > end.
      > ```
      >
      > Some simple languages use dynamic scoping *(e.g., shell scripting languages like Perl allow the programmer to choose static or dynamic scoping when defining a variable)*.
      >
      > So did Common Lisp but later versions of Lisp (e.g. Scheme) are statically scoped.

##### 5.2. Varibale Types

- Types according to the lifetime

  1. **Static variables** - Bound to a memory location before program execution begins and until it ends.

     - Pros - **Efficiency**. i.e., all addressing can be resolved at compile time, there is no allocation/deallocation at run time.
     - Cons - Storage <u>cannot be reused</u>, recursive programs need dynamic variables.

  2. **Stack dynamic variables** - Allocated when the declaration of the variable is processed at run time. 

     > e.g. local variables of recursive procedures.

  3. **Explicit heap-dynamic variables** - Nameless memory cells that are allocated and deallocated by program instructions, using pointers. 

     > e.g. in Java objects are explicit heap dynamic, and are accessed through reference variables, but there is no way to destroy them explicitly: implicit garbage collection is used.

  4. **Implicit heap-dynamic variables** - bound to storage only when they are assigned values.

     > e.g. strings and arrays in Perl and JavaScript.

     1. Pros - flexibility.
     2. Cons - difficult error detection.

- Types according to the scope

  1. **Local variables** are those declared in the block of program that is executed.
  2. **Global variables** are the variables that are visible but are not local.

  > Note: Some languages have static scoping rules whereas others have dynamic scoping rules.

##### 5.3. Assignment

> `variable-name = expression`
>
> Method to change the value of a variable

- `=` - Should not be confused with equivalence in the mathematical sense. Sometimes `:=` is used.
- The value of the expression is stored in the variable, until a new value is given (with another assignment or by a side-effect).
- In typed languages, the expression and the variable must have compatible types.

> e.g.
>
> The language C has a notation for combining assignment and increment:
>
> `i++` and `++i` change the value of `i` to the current value plus 1 and return the value of `i` and `i+1` respectively.
> There are also instructions combining assignment and decrement, written `i--`, `--i`.

### 6. Flow of Control

##### 6.1. Control Statement

- Definition

  - Programs in imperative languages are sequences of instructions. The next instruction that will be executed is the one that follows in the text of the program, unless a control statement is used.

  - The main <u>control statements</u> in imperative languages are:

    1. **selection constructs**, 
    2. **looping constructs**,
    3. **branching instructions**.

    > Any sequential algorithm can be coded with just selection (if-then-else) and logically controlled iteration (while). Branching instructions (go-to) are superfluous.

  - All languages contain more constructs to facilitate the writing of programs. Moreover, several statements can be grouped together to form a compound statement.

- Selection Statements

  - Definition

    - Used to choose between two or more execution paths in a program. 
    - We distinguish *two-way selectors* and *multiple selectors*.

  - Two-way selectors

    - Depending on the language, the semantics of nested selectors vary:

      > e.g.
      >
      > ```java
      > if (sum == 0)
      >   if (count == 0)
      >     (result = 0);
      > else
      >   result = 1;
      > ```
      >
      > The semantics of Java specifies that the else is matched with the most recent unpaired then clause (the inner one in this example). 
      >
      > Since this implicit association may be confusing, some languages require the use of specific syntax for nesting selectors.

  - Multiple selectors

    - Multiple selectors are a generalisation of two-way selectors.

      > e.g.
      >
      > ```java
      > switch (expression) {
      >   case constant-expr-1 : statement-1; 
      >   ...
      >   case constant-expr-n : statement-n; 
      >   [default : statement-n+1]
      > }
      > 
      > ```
      >
      > In some languages at the end of a branch the control goes to the instruction after the selector, in others we need an explicit break or return.

- Iterative Statements (Loops)

  - Definition
    - Iterative constructs cause a statement or sequence of statements (the body of the loop) to be repeated.
    - If the test for <u>loop completion is done before the execution of the body</u> we say that it is a **pre-test loop**, and if it occurs after the body is executed, it is a **post-test loop**.
    - Types: **counter-controlled** and **logically-controlled loops**.
  - Counter-controlled loops
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > the for statement of C, Java:
    >
    > ```java
    > // pseudo code
    > for (expr-1; expr-2; expr3)
    >   loop-body
    >   
    > // example code
    > for (index = 0; index ≤ 10; index++) 
    >   sum = sum + list[index];
    > ```
    >
    > Here *expr-1* initializes the counter, *expr-2* is the loop control evaluated before each execution of the *loop-body*, and *expr-3* is executed after each execution of the *loop-body*.
  - Logically-controlled loops
  
    - Most imperative languages have **pre-** and **post-test loop** constructs. 
  
      > e.g. in C++, Java, there is a while loop and a do loop.
      >
      > ```java
      > // pseudo code
      > while (expression) 
      >   loop-body 
      > //============= 
      > do
      >   loop-body
      > while (expression)
      > ```
      >
      > The while is pre-test (loop-body executed as long as the expression evaluates to True); the do is post-test (loop-body executed until the expression evaluates to False).
  
    - Variants: Pascal’s repeat loop executes the body until the expression evaluates to True.
  
      > e.g.
      >
      > ```pascal
      >  repeat
      >    loop-body
      >    until (expression)
      > ```

##### 6.2. Structuring the Program

- Terminology

  - `Blocks`

    - A block is a group of statements, delimited by keywords such as begin and end, or by separators, like { and }.
    - A block may contain not only commands, but also declarations (of constants, variables or types). If the language has static scope, these will only be visible inside the block (they are local).

  - `Subprogram`

    - Subprogram is a generic name for a named block that can be invoked explicitly. 
    - In this case the block of statements is executed upon invocation, and the control returns to the calling point after the execution of the subprogram.

    > e.g.
    >
    > *procedures* in Pascal, *functions* in C, *methods* in Java.
    
  - `Parameters`
  
    - When a subprogram is declared, together with the name we can associate *parameters*. 
    - These are called **formal parameters**, whereas the ones provided when the subprogram is invoked are the **actual parameters**.
    - The values of the actual parameters will be replaced for the formal parameters when the subprogram is invoked.
    - Different languages use different parameter passing mechanisms.
