##### 23.1. System Defines Mechanism

- Introduction to Access Control Policy
  - File Sharing
    - File Sharing allows multiple users or processes to share with the same file, while the OS only need to keep a copy of it. 

    - Access to objects that may be shared is controlled by the OS. 

      > e.g.
      >
      > Alice can read Alice's mail, but Bob cannot. 

  - Motivation
    - Most modern operating systems are multi-user, that it gives processes a "user identity" so to support with file sharing. Abstractly, it is like a label denoting privilege. 
    - In order to prevent unauthorised modification to the files from other users, there is an **access control policy** that resolved with the permission problems of files, including the permission of r*ead, write and execute*, basing on that user identity. 

  - Access Control Policy

    - OSs aim to provide expressive mechanisms that can represent a range of policies. The specific policy is decided by the users of the system. 

      > e.g.
      >
      > Alice might create a file that anyone can read, but only she can write. 
      >
      > Alice might also create a file that both she and Bob can read and read, but others cannot access. 

    - Example design of Unix

      - In Unix, permission checking is done only at `open()`, if we want to `open()` a file by pathname, and then `read()` and `write()` on file handles. 

      - Permission bits

        - Structure

          > e.g.
          >
          > `alice@host $ ls -l ~/mail`
          >
          > `-rw-------- 1 alice alice 450871 Mar 4 2023 /home/alice/mail`

        - `rw-` - *owner* (`alice` in this example) can read and write but not execute

        - `---` - other members of the *group* `alice` can do nothing

        - `---` - other users can do nothing
      
          > e.g.
          >
          > `k2144518@5CCS2OSC: $ ls -ld /shared drwxr-xr-x 4 k2144518 nms_informatics_staff 4096 Mr 9 12:19 5CCS2OSC`

      - Properties

        - **Permission bits** are stored in a Unix filesystem data structure called the `inode` (~ one per file). 

          - After `open()`, having the file handle is enough. Checks are not done at `read()` or `write()`. 

          - However, file descriptors may be restricted at the time of `open()`. 
      
            > e.g.
            >
            > If we did `int fd = open("/home/alice/mail", O_RDONLY); `, then only `read()`, not `write()` will succeed on handle `fd`. 

      - This design means
      
        - Cost of checking is *amortised*
        - **Delegation** is possible, because it can even transmit `fd` to other proceses. 
        - But **revocation** is hard, since changing permissions doesn't revoke open `fds`. 

##### 23.2. Modelling Polices

- Access Control Matrix

  - We can draw a big table of who has what access to which object. 

    >     e.g.
    >
    >     |         | `/etc/passwd` | `/vmunix` | `/usr/bin/ls` | `/home/alice/project` |
    >     | ------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
    >     | alice   | read          | -         | read, execute | read, write           |
    >     | bob     | read          | -         | read, execute | read, write           |
    >     | charlie | read          | -         | read, execute | -                     |
    >     | dave    | read          | -         | read, execute | -                     |

    - This is an **access control matrix**. 
    - For representing the matrix into data structures on a running system, we can 
      1. Store with each objects <u>in a list of pairs</u> *(who, what permission)*. These are **access control lists (ACLs)**. 
      2. Give each subject with <u>a list of pairs</u> *(which object, what access)*. Each of these paris is a **capability**, like a file descriptor. 

- Access control lists (ACLs)

  - Properties

    - Unix's `user`, `group`, `other` permission bits are a lmitied ACL. 
    - Full explicit ACLs can become <u>large (when added up) and performance-sensitive (if checks are frequent)</u>. 

  - ACL with objects

    - ACLs protect the object, at the object. 

      > e.g., Unix files at `open()` time. Each file has a (short) ACL. 

      - Pros ✅

        1. Easy to revoke, since just need to take name off the list
        2. Easy to understand audit

      - Cons ❌

        1. Scale can become a problem if there are many `{users, files, actions}`. 

           > e.g.
           >
           > Unix has many heuristics aimed at sensible ACL by default: current `uid/gid`, `umask`, `setgid` & sticky directories, etc. 

        2. **Authority** is ambiend, based on "who you are". It cannot *delegate fine-grained access* to some code/process. 

           > i.e., ACL is basing on the identification of user, so it can decide which user can access with which object, but cannot decide like the permission of some specific parts of code or processes. 

           > e.g.
           >
           > Not workable when ACLs with <u>distinct permissions for each process</u>. 

      > Problems will be more serious when distribution. 

- Capability lists

  - Properties

    - The descriptor encapsulates *which file* and *what access*. 
    - Specifically, store capabilities are not with each user but with <u>each process</u>, that enabling them to be *fine-grained* and *dynamic*. 

  - Capabilities with subject, active and maybe process

    - A capability is an unforgeable **token of authority** on some object. 

    - It is a pair of *<object reference, access rights>*. Possessing a valid reference is enough. 

      > e.g., File descripotrs. 
      >
      > - Kernel maintains table of valid `fds`
      > - Can delegate
      > - Hard to revoke

    - Capabilities deeply affect *how programs refer to protected objects*. 

      - Can be fine-grained. 
      - Designated, not ambient. 

      > Validation check can be distributed using cryptography. 


##### 23.3. Summary

| ACLs                            | Capabilities                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Stored with objects             | Stored with subjects                          |
| Check permissions on *access*   | Check permission on *issue + validity* on use |
| Easy to revoke                  | Hard to revoke                                |
| Hard to delegate                | Easy to delegate                              |
| Usually coarse-grained          | Easily made fine-grained                      |
| Easy to audit                   | Hard to audit *(e.g., following delegation)*  |
| Easy to retrofit                | Must usally "design in"                       |
| Tend to bottleneek distrubution | Distributes more scalably                     |
| Authority is ambient            | Authority is designated                       |

### 24. Definitions

##### 24.1. Introduction on Security

- Security means adversarial

  - Security is a mindset of constant suspicion. (who/what am I forced to trust & who/what is trustworthy)

  - Security mechanisms must be designed for *'adversarial' situations*, i.e., someone is actively tryign to break them. 

    > Actually C, Unix, the Internet were not really designed like this. 

  - Security contrasts with fault-talerance

    - **Fault-tolerance** - Protecting processes (or other resources) <u>from accidental error</u> (e.g., Incompletence). 
    - **Security** - Protecting processes or other resources <u>from adversarial (malicious) behaviour</u>. 

    > The two are often conflated, but they differ in pratice. 

- Properties

  - **Confidentiality** - Information is not *disclosed* to unintended parties. 

  - **Integrity** - Information is not *modifiable* by unintended parties (i.e., tamper-proof), or at least not without giveaway (i.e., tamper-evident). 

    > Modification includes unintended creatin, *e.g., of fake/spurious data*. 

  - **Availability** - Malicious actors cannot deprive others of the service (e.g., denail of service attck or `fork()` bomb. )

  - **Authenticity** - Will be mentioned at *25.1.* 

- Notice that

  - These properties are only ever provided <u>up to certain assumptions (*attack model*) and budget (*attack resources*)</u>. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > Can an attcker break into your house
    >
    > Can an attacker plant agents in your orgranisation

  - These properties are almost always trade off against performance and convenience. 

##### 24.2. Security and Access Control

- Polices to formulate

  - Motivation
  	- We can formulate policies about **confidentiality** and **integraity**, like ACLs or capabilities. 
  	- To protect availability, i.e., prevent 'denial of service' attacks, we would need to add some kind of *resource limits*. 

    	> e.g. 
    	>
    	> Set a max {#processes, allocated physical memory, ...} per user. 
    	>
    	> Limit rate of process creation (or similar things) per user. 

  - Human bottleneck

    - Correctly enforcing policies is the easy part, while the following human problems is more serious. 

      - Getting plicies right. 
      - Mitigating when things go wrong (Swiss chesse layers). 
      - Bootstrapping the user notation, i.e., authentication. 

    - Complexity birngs expressiveness but also potential for human error. 

      > e.g.
      >
      > `$ ls -l /path/to/my/file`
      >
      > `-rw-r--r-- 1 fred staff 14507 May 1 2019 /path/to/my/file`
      >
      > This is complex. File has `rwx-`style permissions, but also has
      >
      > - Directory traversal rules
      > - Per-filesystem options
      > - On modern Unix, also a near-arbitrary access control list

- Layers of defence (a.k.a. the Swiss cheese model)
  - Security is NEVER absolute, since
    - It is relative to attack model and attacker budget. 
    - Methods are often complex, means can be incorrrectly performed. 
  - Effective computer security relies on *layers of defence*. 
    
  - Each layer of defence is a distinct pratice or technique, and often at different layers in the system. 
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > - Defensive programming
    > - Static analysis
    > - Use of languages with dynamic safety properties
    > - Strong user-system and system-user authentication
    > - Authentication of installed software
    > - Tight access control policy, including least-priviledge operation. 
    > - Network security, e.g., firewalling. 
    > - Audit trail (logging)
    > - User training
    > - Staff training
    > - ...

##### 24.3. Supporting Least Privilege in the OS

- Privilege Escalation

  - When run a program on the system like this `stephen@ernest-7$ ./myprog`, Usually it gets <u>all of the privileges</u>. 

    - It is convenient, and fine if the program is correct and trustwhothy.
    - But this bring a potential security risk. Since web servers are big and complex, unlikely all the programs are correct and trustworthy. 

  - Complex software can often be tricked or exploited, so might do unitended things. This is called **privilege escalation**. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > For system processes, 
    >
    > `root@ernest-7$ ./httpd  # run a web server`
    >
    > It is not wise to give all the privileges. 
    >
    > Note that on a Unix system, `root` is the superuser (a.k.a. administrator) and has permission to do everything. 

- Least Privilege

  - Web servers don't need permission to do everything. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > For system processes, 
    >
    > `root@ernest-7$ ./httpd  # run a web server`
    >
    > We may want to make a new user that is just the web server instead of using `root`. 
    >
    > `root@ernest-7:$ sudo -u httpd ./httpd # run as the user 'httpd'`
    >
    > Then revise our access control policy to say waht the 'web server user' can do, i.e., lessen its privileges to be (a better approximation of) only the least privilege it needs. Then even if it is vulnerable to exploit, the worst it can do is the things the user can do, instead of anything. 


##### 24.4. Splitting up privilege

- It's hard work to divide up privileges really fine, since it needs

  - Create all those distinct users with corresponding set of privileges. Wrong setting will let the programs fail. 
  - Some programs need to combine multiple authorities

    > e.g. `student@5CCS2OSC:$ submit 1 ~/my-proj-1`
    >
    > This program needs
    > - Permission of students - on the project files
    > - Permission of the lecturer - on submission dir, making info, ...

    > The Unix 80% solution is `setuid` and `segtid` programs. 

- Special permission bits in Unix: *set user ID* and *set group ID*

  - Permission bits

    > e.g.
    >
    > `$ ls -l /shared/5CCS2OSC/submit`
    > `-rwsrws--x l k2144518 k2144518 1102992 Mar 9 12:19 /shared/5CCS2OSC/submit`
    >
    > first `s` - when run (by anyone), uid is owning uid
    >
    > second `s` - when run (by anyone), gid is owning gid
    >
    > final `x` - anyone can run

  - System calls methods
    - A program's owner can make it `setuid` meaning "run with any privileges, not the invoking user's"
    - The `seteuid()` system call allows programs to drop the owner's privileges and switch to the invoking user's. 
    - `setgid` is the same idea but apply to the *group ID*. 
  - This allows flexible combinations of invoker's and owner's authorities. 
    - Notice that, "Flexible" means *complex and liable to be got wrong*. 
    - `submit` is simple enough to be auditable, but not all setuid programs are so simple. 

- Setuid Programs

  > e.g.
  >
  > `stephen@ernest-7$ ls /usr/bin/pkexec`
  > `-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 27468 Jan 18 2022 /usr/bin/pkexec`
  
  - Approach
  
    - A setuid program owned by root is called **setuid root**. It is *dangerous*, since it will run as the all-powerful root user.
    - A setuid program is usually controlled by a configuration file to <u>allow a few carefully chosen privileged things</u> that the system doesn't otherwise let ordinary users do. 
  
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > Launch a program as another, restricted user (like `httpd`). 
    >
    > Launch a program that directly accesses a specific device. 
  - Safety
  
    - A program like the example may face some problems. 
  
    - Privilege escalation
  
      > i.e.
      >
      > Badly-written setuid code allows any user to get root, if they run the code the ‘right way’.
      >
      > The exploit is non-trivial: requires working with several incidental ‘found’ components of the program, and working around some defensive programming by stringing together multiple tricks.
      >
      > The key vulnerability it exploits is a buffer overflow.
  
    - Confused deputy, a special case of privilege escalation
  
      > i.e.
      >
      > Confused deputies happen when buggy code is acting under two or more authorities...

##### 24.5. Preventing Attacks

- Systems without using setuid root

- Fine-grained and explicit use of authority

  - Only use the root privilege for the operation that needs it, i.e., for running the requested child program. 
  - Goal - Eliminate the ambient authority, 
    - i.e., No notion of current UID, 
    - Make sure the only special privilege granted to the program is "can create a new process as a different user", 
    - All operations must explicitly designate what authority they act under. 
  - Method
    - By using more handles
  
      > e.g. 
      >
      > To create a process, open a file, etc., `pkexec` did not have to choose a privileged handle. Its ‘root authority’ was ‘ambient’ in its user ID.
  
      - For file writing and reading, and
      - Using `pkexec` as a priviledged handle to achieve 
        - Creating handles to find and open files, and 
        - Achieve syscall for new process. 
  
        > Note. 
        >
        > There is no way to create such handles in a traditional Unix-like OS. 
  
- Bounds checking, a.k.a. memory-safe execution
  - Check the bounds to prevent buffer overflow attack. *e.g., Implementation in Java.*

### 25. Authentication

##### 25.1. Introduction to Authenticity

- Authenticity

  - A property of security about that, communicated information is what it purports to be, including communicating parties being <u>who they purport to be</u>. 

  - Authentication is about establishing trust in identity.

    > i.e., For the following questions
    >
    > Does the system trust a user’s claimed identity, and
    >
    > Does a user trust the system’s claimed identity, etc.

- Common mechanisms for authenticating

  1. A thing you know *(e.g. a password)*
  2. A thing you have *(e.g. a key, a smartcard, ...)*
  3. A thing you are *(e.g. biometrics, Shibboleth-speaking, ...)*
  4. Or something combined with the previous

##### 25.2. Authentication by Password 

- Password authentication

  - Passwords are strangely popular in spite of gigantic security and usability problems. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > - Password can be forgotten
    > - Password can be weak/guessable
    > - Password can be leaked
    > - Password is not subsequently confined (knowledge spreads)

  - Avoiding the no-excuses failure

    - Idea - Don't store passwords **directly**. 

    - The process how the system check the correctness of a password $p$:

      1. Store some function of the password, $f(p)$. 
      2. $\text{check}(f(p)) = f(\text{input})$. Note that $f(p)$ is stored so we don't need to compute it. 
      3. Wisely choosing the function $f$. 
  
    - A good choice of $f$ would be a **cryptographic hash function**. 

      > Note.
      >
      > This is not the same as encrypting the passwords, and *knowing the hashes* does not help an attacker very much.
      >
      > Most mass leaks of passwords *(e.g. from popular web sites)* are only possible because passwords are stored in the clear. <u>Any CS graduate should know this is a no-no.</u> 
  
- Methods to prevent some obvious attacks

  - **Dictionary attack** - try all dictionary words

    - Defence - rate limit also helps, but less so. Better approach is to forbid 'dictionary' words. 

  - **Brute-force attack** - try all strings (from the min length)

    - Defence - rate-limit # authentication attempts per second escalatingly

      > e.g., 30 min lock out after n times wrong

  - **Offline dictionary attack** - suppose stored username/password info has leaked

    - Even if stored as hashes, can use the dictionary technique 'offline' on leaked data. Attacker not using our login service. 
  
    - Defence - don't allow dictionary words, so attack degrades to brute force. Strong hash function can force *attacker budget* into the unaffordable. 
  
  - **Timing channel attack** - measure #μ*s* it takes for the login program to say no.
  
    - Naive login program, as delay ∝ #characters matched. This turns exponential into linear. 
  
    - Defence - insert *randomised* delay (but better - don't store passwords)
  
      > Timing channels are one kind of *covert channel*...
  


##### 25.3. Authentication by other methods

- Authentication by the OS? 
  
  - Password systems are usually implemented badly. 
    - OSes are pretty good nowadays, but most password auth occurs via random websites, or other {immature, overcomplex} codebases. 
    - Application can't use authentication mechanisms provided by the OS, since
      - Cultural factors, including ossified Unix-style OS designs.
      - Therefore there is a need for better, more flexible OSs. 
  
- Alternatives to passwords

  - Popular at the moment is **two-factor**, in the form of *password + something else, like the mobile phone SMS number*. 
    - It might be easy to implement but inconvenient to use. 
  - Other methods may include with
    - **password manager**, simplest but centralises risk. 
    - **cryptographic methods** *(e.g. challenge/response protocols)*, could be better. 
    - Keep cryptographic secrets in **specialised hardware** *(e.g. Yubikeys)* that can perform these protocols more trust worthily. 

- Authentication the other way

  - System to User

    - **Untrappable key combinations**
      - OS guarantees that applications cannot intercept this key combination, so the log in screen that appears must be genuine, if the system is running the OS you think it is. 

  - Websites

    - **Cryptographic certificate verification**
      - Your browser gains assurance you’re really talking to the claimed site by cryptographically checking a *certificate* that is signed by a chain of well-known authorities.
      - Need to trust your OS + browser + the ‘*chain of trust*’ of cryptographic certificate issuers

  - Software

    - Most software is delivered over an inherently insecure network (the Internet), further authentication techniques are needed to catch malicious software. 

    - The OS is an early link in most chains of trust: we rely on its assurances for any higher-level assurances. 

      > e.g. 
      >
      > About the contents of a trusted certificates file. 
      >
      > Certificate checks done by browser when visiting a web site. 

    - Usually this amounts to *certificate-based* checking of the **authenticity** of the source on the network, and *cryptographic hash*-based checking of the **integrity** of the received binaries.

### 26. Cryptography

##### 26.1. Introduction to Cryptography

- Definition

  - **Cryptography** is the study of techniques for <u>secure communication</u>, where

    - Secure means <u>in the presence of adversaries</u>, 
    - Techniques means specifically techniques <u>involving codes</u>.

    > e.g.
    >
    > If your communication is *physically secure*, that is, if only intended parties can physically participate (receiving, transmitting, reading, writing...), then you have no need of cryptography.

- Application of Cryptography

  - OSs only use a little cryptography, which invovles 
    - When have exclusive control of (many) data paths in the hardware. 
    - When isolate processes from each other. 
    - Others up to some attack model...
  - Cryptography is commonly used in web applications, like browsers, etc. 

  > Note. 
  >
  > Data paths out of the machine are not so controlled, like physical attacks cannot be  prevented by cryptography.

- Property

  - Confidentiality - communication whose content is secret
  - Integrity - communication whose content is tamper-proof or tamper-evident
  - Authenticity - communication where parties are known to be who they claim
  - Non-repudiation
    - parties cannot falsely deny their prior messages (‘only *X* could have generated message *Y* ’)
  - Plausible deniability

##### 26.2. Cryptography Formalised

- Terminology
  - **Ciphers**
    - A Cipher is <u>a pair of functions</u> $E, D$, where for encrypt and for decrypt, respectively. 
    - Cryptography works by the use of ciphers. 
    
  - Message
  
    - **Plaintext** - Unencrypted messages, denoted as $P$.
    - **Ciphertext** - Encrypted messages, denoted as $C$​​.
    
  - Key
  
    - **Secret key**
  
      - Used to parameterise the cipher, denoted as $K$. 
      
      - Design it to twiddle bits in ways that **depend on** $K$.
      
      - $C = E (P, K)$ 
        $P = D(C, K)$

- Describing the properties

  - Confidentiality

    - To send $P$ - transmit $C=E(P, K)$
    - Recipient recovers $P = D(C, K)$. 

  - Integrity

    - To send $P$ - transmit $C = E(P++\text{ hash}(P), K)$​

    - Recipient uses $K$ to decrypt as $M=(Q++H)$ and checks $H = \text{hash}(Q)$​

      >
      > An attacker who does not know $K$ might be able to twiddle bits *en route*, and this might (or might not) successfully decrypt as some modified message $M' = (Q'++H')$.
      >
      > However, without $K$ it is infeasible (given a strong cipher) for them to arrange that $H' = \text{hash}(Q')$ so the recipient can detect their tampering.

  - Authenticity
  
    - Use a *challenge–response protocol*
      - To challenge - send a random number (nonce) $X$​
  
      - Response of $E(X,K)$ proves the responder knows key $K$. 
  
    - Degenerate case is passwords. Challenge is empty, $E$​ is identity function.

##### 26.3. Practical ciphers

- Symmetric cipher

  - Definition
    - The same key works for encrypting and decrypting.
    - The goal of a practical cipher is to be computationally infeasible to crack, *i.e. to decrypt without the key*, while being computationally *affordable* to encode or decode with the key, and without requiring *too long a key*.

  - Properties
    - Many are **block ciphers** - they work on <u>fixed-size chunks of data</u>, using a fixed-size key.
    - One big idea is to **exploit exponentials**
      - The size of key space grows exponentially with length. 
      - If there is no asymptotically faster cracking method than brute force (try all possible key values), then we can just choose leng*th*($K$​) such that cracking would take longer than life of universe.
      - Many ciphers with 128-bit keys continue to be regarded as secure.


  > e.g. AES

- Asymmetric key cryptography

  - Idea
    - Key distribution is a *big* problem.

- RSA

- Cryptographic hashing
