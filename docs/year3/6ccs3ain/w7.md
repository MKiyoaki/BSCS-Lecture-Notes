### 7.1. Introduction to Game Theory

##### 7.1.1. Definitions

- A framework for analysing interactions between a set of agents.
- Bastract specification of interactions.
- Describes each agent's preferences in terms of their utility. 
- Give a range of **solution strategies** with which we can make some predictions about how agents should interact. 

##### 7.1.2. Applications

- Competition bettwen agents
  - School admissions
- Multi-party decision making
  - Military strategic analysis
  - The grade game
  - Choose side of road when driving

##### 7.1.3. Payoff Matrices

- **Payoff Matrices** - Can be used to record the reward for each agent basing on their decisions

  > e.g.
  >
  > Choose side game can be simulated as following, 
  >
  > |   i \ j   | Left | Right |
  > | :-------: | :--: | :---: |
  > |  **Up**   | 1, 0 | 0, 0  |
  > | **Right** | 0, 0 | 1, 1  |
  >
  > We have two agents, each player picking a (pure) strategy. 
  >
  > - Agent $i$ is the row player, gets the first reward in a cell.
  > - Agent $j$ is the column player, gets the second reward in a cell.

- **Outcomes** - what we get when we combine the actions of all the players.

  - An outcome corresponds to an element of the payoff matrix.

  > e.g.
  >
  > Consdier the above choose side game matrix.
  >
  > We identify outcomes by the moves the players make: $(\text{what }i\text{ plays, what }j\text{ plays})$.
  >
  > Thus $(\text{up, right})$ identifies the outcomes in which $i$ plays $\text{up}$ and $j$ plays $right$.

- Payoff matrices can be split into multiple matrices. One (Call $A$) that specifies the payoff to $i$ and another $B$ to $j$. 

  - Sometimes this payoff matrix could be represented as $(A, B)$. 
  - $a_{i', j'}$ represents the payoff if $i$ picks action $i'$ and $j$ picks action $j'$. 

  > e.g. 
  >
  > $A = \begin{pmatrix}1 &0 \\ 3 &1\end{pmatrix}$ is the payoff matrix for $i$  from the above table.

### 7.2. Dominant Strategies

##### 7.2.1. Introduction to Dominat Strategies

- Rational agent behave with several possible strategies in a given scenario

  > e.g.
  >
  > Play dominat strategy, nash equilibrium strategy, pareto optimal strategy, etc. 

- Definition

  - Given any particular strategy $s$, agent $i$, there will be a number of possible outcomes.
  - We say **$s_1$ dominates $s_2$** if every outcome possible by $i$ playing $s_1$ is *preferred* over every outcome possible by $i$ playing $s2$. 
    - $s_1$ strongly dominates $s_2$ if the utility of every outcome possible by $i$ playing $s_1$ is <u>strictly greater</u> than every outcome possible by $i$ playing $s_2$. i.e., $u(s_1) > u(s_2)$, for all outcomes.
    - $s_1$ weakly dominates $s_2$ if the utility of every outcome possible by $i$ playing $s_1$ is <u>no less than</u> every outcome possible by $i$ play $s_2$. i.e., $u(s_1) \geq u(s_2)$ for all outcomes. 

  > e.g.
  >
  > | i \ j |      D      |       C       |
  > | :---: | :---------: | :-----------: |
  > | **D** |    2, 1     |    2, *4*     |
  > | **C** | <u>5</u>, 1 | <u>5</u>, *4* |
  >
  > In this game, $C$ dominates $D$ for both players. 

- Features

  - A rational agent will **never** play a dominated strategy. 
  - Thus in deciding what to do, we can delete dominated strategies.
  - There isn't always a unique undominated strategy.
