##### 5.1.1. Block Cipher and SKE

- **Perfectnes**s of a block cipher

  > e.g.
  >
  > Suppose a block cipher $F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l$. Perfect means:
  >
  > - Inverting $F$ costs approximately $2^n$: The best attack is brute force.
  > - On a uniform $sk$ we cannot distinguish $F_{sk}$ from a uniform permutation.
  > - Effecient design in hardware and software? 

  - By a given perfect block cipher, we can build SKE and MAC. 

- Definition

  - A $\text{SKE = (KGen, Enc, Dec)}$ has $\mathcal{M, C, K}$ such that
    - $\text{KGen}$ returns a $sk$ sampled from $\mathcal{K}$,
    - For $m \in \mathcal{M}$ encryption is $\text{Enc}(sk, m) = c \in C$, 
    - For $c \in \mathcal{C}$ decryption is $\text{Dec}(sk, \text{Enc}(sk, m)) = m$. 
  - Correctness
    - For all $m \in \mathcal{M}, sk \in \mathcal{K}$, we have $\text{Dec}(sk, \text{Enc}(sk, m)) = m$.
  - Open
    - The algorithms of SKE are all public, only $sk$ is secret. 
    - i.e., Even though the attacker knows the algorithms, they cannot access the plaintext if they don't know $sk$. 
  - Security (Intuition)
    - Adversaries cannot learn anything about the encrypted message given access to $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$.
      - Let $sk \leftarrow \text{KGen}$ and $b \in \{0, 1\}$ sampled uniformly,
      - $\mathcal{A}$ with $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$ outputs $m_0, m_1 \in \mathcal{M}$ of the same length,
      - $\mathcal{A}$ with $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$ recevies $c = \text{Enc}(sk, m_b)$,
      - $\mathcal{A}$ outputs $b' \in \{0, 1\}$ and wins when $b = b'$.
    - If no adversaries win with probability (meaningfully) more than one half, then **$\text{SKE}$ is secure**. 
  
  > e.g.
  >
  > Given $F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l$, then
  >
  > - $\text{KGen}$ samples $sk$ uniformly from $\{0, 1\}^n$,
  > - For $m \in \mathcal{M} = \{0, 1\}^l$, let $\text{Enc}(sk, m) = F_{sk}(m) \in \mathcal{C} = \{0, 1\}^l$, 
  > - For $c \in \mathcal{C}$, let $m = F_{sk}^{-1}(c)$. 
  >
  > For $m$ with different lengths, i.e., $\mathcal{M} = \{0, 1\}^*$, 
  >
  > 1. Unambiously pad $m$ to $m' \in \{0, 1\}^{\mathcal{U}}$
  > 2. Encrypted blcok by block? 

##### 5.1.2. Necessity of Randomness

- Motivation
  - Consider the scenarios that we want to use the encryption to win the security game.
    - Select any distinct $m_0, m_1$ of the same length, e.g., $m_0, m_1 \in \{0, 1\}^l$.
    - Learn $c_0 = \text{Enc}(sk, m_0), c_1 = \text{Enc}(sk, m_1)$ from the oracle,
    - $c = \text{Enc}(sk, m_0)$ will equal either $c_0$ or $c_1$, thus the message is not secure anymore. 
  - We can NOT allow $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$ to be deterministic. Since attacker can observe the pattern between deterministic encrypted ciphertext and plaintext. 
  - i.e., The encryption algorithm must be **probablistic**. 
- Solution
  - A function $f: X \to Y$ has no concept of randomness. Instead, we give the randomness as a **separate input**,
    - Let $\mathcal{R}=\{0, 1\}^p, f: X \times \mathcal{R} \to Y$, so called *random coins* $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$ are sampled uniformly and $f(x; \rho)$. 
    - Attacker cannot know the message by observing the pattern of messages.
  - This means
    - Encrypting the same length message several times (should) **give different ciphertexts**, 
    - Therefore, to be able to decrypt, we **must have $|\mathcal{C}| > |\mathcal{M}|$**. 

##### 5.1.3. Mode of Operations for Block CIpher*

- Introduciton
  - Block CIpher Modes of Operation define how to securely encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data using a block cipher.
  - A block cipher is an encryption algorithm that processes data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128 bits) rather than one bit at a time. 
  - However, to encrypt data larger than a single block, different modes of operation are used to ensure both security and efficiency.

### 5.2. Modes of Operation for SKE

##### 5.2.1. Electronic Code Book (ECB) Mode

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241216150427964834/1.webp" alt="Electronic Code Book" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Definition
  - ECB is an encryption scheme for block ciphers. 
  - Each plaintext block $m_i$ is encrypted *independently* to ciphertext block $c_i$, i.e., $c_i = E_i(m_i)$. 

- Evaluation
  - Correctness (Exercise)
  - Open (Under your control)
  - (In)secure
    - If two plaintext blocks are same, the corresponding ciphertext blocks are same as well. Thus the attacker can analysis the pattern of encryption mapping method and the security cannot be guaranteed. 


##### 5.2.2. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241216150551381074/2.webp" alt="Cipher Block Chaining " style="zoom:67%;" />

- Process

  - Encryption algorithm will sample a uniform $IV$ at first.

    - $F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l$ is a block cipher, 

      $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}=\cup_{i \in \mathbb{N}}\{0, 1\}^{il}$

      $\mathcal{K} = \{0, 1\}^n$

    - $\text{KGen}$ samples $sk$ uniformly from $\mathcal{K}$. 

  - $\text{Enc}(sk, m)$ for $m \in \{0, 1\}^{tl}$

    - Sample uniform $IV \in \{0, 1\}^l$ and parse $m = m_1, ..., m_t$ in $l$ bit blocks,
    - $c_0 = IV$
    - for $i \in \{1, ..., t\}$ let $c_i = F_{sk} (c_{i-1} ⊕ m_i)$ 
    
      > i.e., Encrypt the first block with a initial vector $IV$ by taking XOR operation, then 
      > Encrypt the following blocks by taking XOR for the plaintext with the ciphertext. 

- Properties

  - Encryption
    - $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$ uses randomness: $\mathcal{R} = \{0, 1\}^l, \text{Enc}(sk, \cdot ; \rho)$ for the $IV$. 
    - The ciphertexts are longer, $c_0 \in \{0, 1\}^l$ is added,
    - has to be computed **sequentially**, rather than in parallel.
  - Decryption
    - $\text{Dec}(sk, c)$ for $c \in \{0, 1\}^{(t+1)l}$
    - Parse $c = c_0 c_1 ... c_t$ as length $l$ blocks,
    - for $i \in \{1, ..., m\}$ let $m_i = c_{i-1} ⊕ F^{-1}_{sk}(c_i)$.
    - Decryption can be performed **in parallel**, and the $IV$ (i.e., $c_0$) is required.

- Evaluation

  - Correctness (exercise), 
  - Open (under your control), 
  - Secure - If $F$ is a good block cipher and $l$ is large enough.

##### 5.2.3. Counter Mode

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241216150852607053/5.webp" alt="5" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Definition

  - $F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l$ is a block cipher, 

    $\mathcal{M = C = \cup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \{0, 1\}^{il}}$

    $\mathcal{K} = \{0, 1\}^n$

  - $\text{Enc}(sk, m)$ for $m \in \{0, 1\}^{tl}$

    - sample uniform $IV \in \{0, 1\}^l$ and parse $m = m_1 ... m_t$ in $l$ bit blocks,
    - $c_0 = IV$,
    - for $i \in \{1, ..., t\}$ let $c_i = F_{sk}(IV + i) ⊕ m_i$. 

      > Here $IV+i$ is an abuse of notation. If $IV=0110$ then $IV+1=0111$ and $IV + 2 = 1000$.

- Evaluation (Counter Mode vs. CBC vs. ECB)

  - Encryption
    - Just like CBC, $\text{Enc}(sk, \cdot)$ uses randomness and ciphertexts are longer.
    - Unlike CBC, once $IV$ is sampled, can be computed in parallel. 
    - $F_{sk}$ does not have to be permutation (never inverted for decryption). 
  - Decryption
    - For Decryption algorithm $\text{Dec}(sk, c), c \in \{0, 1\}^{(t+1)l}$:
      - Parse $c = c_0c_1...c_t$ as length $l$ blocks, 
      - for $i \in \{1, ..., m\}$, let $m_i = c_i ⊕ F(sk, IV + i)$
    - Decryption can be performed **in parallel,** and the $IV$ (i.e. $c_0$) is required.
  - Correctness, Open, Secure
    - If $F$ is a good block cipher and $l$ is large enough, then yes.

### 5.3. Modes of Operation for MAC

##### 5.3.1. Block Cipher and MAC

- Definition
  - A Message Verification Code $\text{MAC} = (\text{KGen, Tag}, V_f)$ has $\mathcal{M, T, K}$ such that:
    - $\text{KGen}$ is the interal key generation algortihm, which returns a $ik$ sampled from $\mathcal{K}$,
    - for $m \in \mathcal{K}$ forming a tag is $\text{Tag}(ik, m) = \tau \in \mathcal{T}$,
    - for $m \in \mathcal{K}$ and $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ verification is $V_f(ik, m, \tau) \in \{0, 1\}$.
  - Correctness
    - For all $m \in \mathcal{M}$ and $ik \in \mathcal{K}$ we have $V_f(ik, m, \text{Tag}(ik, m)) = 1$.
    - i.e., A correctly generated tag $\tau$, basing on the correct key $ik$ and message $m$, can be verified. 
  - Open
    - The algorithms of $\text{MAC}$ are all public, only $ik$ is secret. 
    - i.e., Even though the attacker knows the algorithms, they cannot access the verification process if they don't know $ik$. 
- Intuition
  - Adversaries given $\text{Tag}(ik, \cdot)$ cannot forge a tag on a message they do not know a tag for.
  - Let $ik \leftarrow \text{KGen}, Q = \empty$,
    - Each time $\mathcal{A}$ with $\text{Tag}(ik, \cdot)$ queries $\tau = \text{Tag}(ik, m)$ add $m$ to $Q$,
    - $\mathcal{A}$ with $\text{Tag}(ik, \cdot)$ outputs $(m^*, \tau^*)$,
    - $\mathcal{A}$ wins if $V_f(ik, m^*, \tau^*) = 1$ and $m^* \notin Q$. 
  
  - If no adversaries win with probability (meaningfully) more than zero then "MAC is secure". 
  

##### 5.3.2. MAC-CBC

[![img](https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/CBC-MAC_structure_%28en%29.svg/570px-CBC-MAC_structure_%28en%29.svg.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/CBC-MAC_structure_(en).svg/570px-CBC-MAC_structure_(en).svg.png)

- Definition
  - We can also build from a block cipher $F : \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l$.
  - $\mathcal{M} = \{0, 1\}^tl, \mathcal{T} = \{0, 1\}^l$ and $\mathcal{K} = \{0, 1\}^n$,
  - $\text{KGen}$ samples $ik$ uniformly from $\mathcal{K}$, 
  - Set $\tau_0 = 0^l$, for $i \in \{1, ..., t\}$ let $\tau_i = F_ik (\tau_{i-1} ⊕ m_i)$,
  - Return $\tau = \tau_t$, i.e., just the last output. 

  > Like Counter mode, we do not require $F_{ik}$ to be a permutation (never inverted). 

- Verification

  - Idea: Just calculate $\tau$ again and see if it matches (canonical verification).

  - $V_f(ik, m, \tau)$:

    - If $m \notin \mathcal{M}$, i.e., $m$ has a length different to $tl$, output 0, else
    - calculate $\tau' = \text{Tag} (ik, m)$ and return 1 if and only if $\tau' = \tau$.

    > Note that for MAC-CBC both $\text{Tag}$ and $V_f$ must proceed sequentially. 

- Evaluation

  - Correctness, Open, Secure
    - If $F$ is a good block cipher, yes.

  - MAC-CBC vs. CBC
    - No $IV$ or $IV=0^l$ for MAC-CBC, and
    - No "intermediate" tags $\tau_1, \tau_2$, ..., i.e., only the final output $\tau_t$ is given.

### 5.4. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

##### 5.4.1. Motivation

- Motivation

  - From observing the previous mentioned operation modes, we noticed that the security always reduces to whether $F$ is a good block cipher with large enough length $l$. 
  - Design of $F$ is fundamental.

- AES

  > In January 1997, NIST announced an open competition to design a block cipher to replace DES. It would receive the name Advanced Encryption Standard.
  >
  > Fifteen algorithms submitted from international teams (spanning continents, academic and industry). Three workshops held (1998, 1999, 2000), after the second the field was reduced to five candidates.
  >
  > Eventually Rijndael (Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen) was selected: secure and performant.

##### 5.4.2. AES

- High-level Design Principles

  - AES is a substitution permutation network.
  - The key length $n \in \{128, 192, 256\}$ called **AES-{128, 192, 256}**. 
  - The block length $l = 128$ and $l'=8$ for all three security levels.
  - Different key schedule and number of rounds $r \in \{10, 12, 14\}$ for $n \in \{128, 192, 256\}$ with each round otherwise identical. 
  - Free, standardised, highly efficient in software and hardware and *studied*.

- Stages*

  > Note.
  >
  > We omit the details of the key schedule, it is rather technical and differs per $n$.
  >
  > We also omit the details of AddRoundKey, it simply lays the round key in a square like the state and performs an XOR.
  >
  > We perform AddRoundKey in the initial round, and skip MixColumns in the final round. 

  1. AddRoundKey
  1. SubBytes
  1. ShiftRows
  1. MixColumns

- The State

  - AES keeps track of a state, think $m^{(i)}$ or $S(m^i ⊕ sk_{i+1})$. It represents the current state of the computation of $F(sk, m)$. 

    > i.e., Initial state will be XOR with initial secret key. After that the state will be updated in each round. 

  - Since $l = 128$ we have $l=16 \cdot 8$, so we think of the state as $16$ bytes in square. 
    $$
    s =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s_{0, 0} &s_{0, 1} &s_{0, 2} &s_{0, 3} \\
    s_{1, 0} &s_{1, 1} &s_{1, 2} &s_{1, 3} \\
    s_{2, 0} &s_{2, 1} &s_{2, 2} &s_{2, 3} \\
    s_{3, 0} &s_{3, 1} &s_{3, 2} &s_{3, 3} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

- MixColumns

  - After the round key comes $S$, The permutation $P$ acts on $\{1, ..., 128\}$, given this representation of state it acts first by rows and then columns. 

  - Now we act on the columns via multiplication by a fixed matrix
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s'_{0, c} \\
    s'_{1, c} \\
    s'_{2, c} \\
    s'_{3, c}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    02 &03 &01 &01 \\
    01 &02 &03 &01 \\
    01 &01 &02 &03 \\
    03 &01 &01 &02 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    s_{0, c} \\
    s_{1, c} \\
    s_{2, c} \\
    s_{3, c}
    \end{bmatrix}
    
    \text{ for } 0 \leq c < 4
    $$

  - Together ShiftRows and MixColumns define $P$.

- Evaluation

  - AES is now widely used as a symmertric encryption standard.
  - It can effectively prevent with the modern crytographic attacks, including burte force attack. 
  - TLS1.3, which is the backbone of the internet allows (almost) exclusively AES modes of operation for (authenticated) encryption.
