>We created a container with ROS and all the required software. In lab machines you can find it at the path: `/store/netsoft/itr-cont/itr.sif . `

##### 1.1. Robot Operation System

- Definition
  - ROS is a Middleware, which provides the “plumbing” to connect many subsystems
  - The most commonly used robots and devices have public ROS packages.
  
- Concepts
  
  - ROS Graph
    - Nodes - the central concept of the ROS ecosystem
      - Nodes are to ROS what processes are to the operating system. They are processes, with the addition of being able of communicating with other nodes.
      - Nodes can be started and stopped at any time and in any order.
    - Communication
      - They can communicate with other nodes in two ways: through *messages* and *services*.
      - All communication between nodes in ROS is through the network, therefore nodes don’t need to be on the same machine.
  
    - *roscore* acts as a DNS to let nodes discover one another. The machine that hosts roscore is called the ROS *master*.
  
  - Rescore
    - Roscore must be run before any node, and allows nodes to find one another
    - Only one roscore must be running in the system at any given time, even across multiple machines.
    - The machine that runs roscore is called the **Rosmaster**.
  
- ROS File System

  - Package
    - A package is the basic software unit. 
    - A package may contain code for several nodes, along with other information.
  - Metapackage
    - Group together packages with related functionality.

### 2. Container

##### 2.1. Container

- Introduction to OS

  >> - The OSs like Linux, for instance, is actually made of many components. It would take a fair amount of effort to put together the components ourselves, therefore they are bundled together in what is called a **distribution**.
  >> - A few central components of the system are:
  >>   - The **kernel**
  >>     - The centre of any OS that manages devices, processes, memory, and so on.
  >>     - The kernel itself runs very few thread. 
  >>     - The vast majority of the software you see in a computer, providing functionality to the user runs in *user space*, that is, is not part of the kernel. 
  >>   - The **system manager**
  >>     - This is the first and only process that the kernel starts
  >>     - The System Manager used in most linux distributions these days is *systemd*.
  >>   - The **window manager**
  >>     - It creates the graphical interface
  >>   - The **package manager**
  >>     - It handles the dependencies between software programs
  >>     - The package manager is important for us, because it’s the only system component that is duplicated in containers.

- Introduction to VM

  >>- A **virtual machine manager**, usually called a **hypervisor**
  >>  - Separates the hardware layer from the software layers above, 
  >>  - Allowing two or more kernels to share CPU, GPU, and memory as if they were the only running kernel.
  >>- Virtual machines can act at the hardware level, so that when you turn on the computer several operating systems start at the same time. 
  >>- Usually this configuration is used for servers and none is accessibly through monitor and keyboard (otherwise, which OS should the monitor show?) but through the network.

  >>- Here virtual machine the hypervisor runs within another operating system. 
  >>
  >>  - When you turn on the computer a single operating system starts normally. 
  >>  - This is called the **host**. Then, the user starts the hypervisor which creates a virtualised isolated environment in which it runs the **guest** operating system.
  >>
  >>  > e.g., VirtualBox and VMware are common type 2 hypervisors.
  >>
  >>- Clearly the virtualisation has a computational cost, because any call that would normally be handled by a kernel has to be routed through two kernels, the guest and the host.

- Container
  - Definition
    - Containers are not virtual machines, in that there is always only one single kernel running. 
    - Containers contain an entire file system, with most system directories such as `/bin` `/sbin` `/lib`, and so on. However, they are isolated from the main root file system and wrap the software that we want to contenerise.
  - Functionalty
    - With containers, ROS and ALL its dependencies, that is all Ubuntu packages it requires, including the package manager apt, can be inside the container.
    - The container, by default, mounts the user’s home directory
      - So that the content of home can be shared between inside and outside the container. 
      - Further directories can be bound so that a system folder is available inside the container.
