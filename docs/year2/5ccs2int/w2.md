### 5. Constraint Satisfaction Problem

##### 5.1. Introduction to CSP

- Introduction

  - Components
    - A finite set of variables $X = \{x^1, ..., x^i\}$​
      - Defines all elements that need to be given a value in the problem. 
    - A set of domains $D = \{D^1, ..., D^i\}$​​
      - Defines what possible values can be assigned <u>to each variable</u>, where the colors can be represented as $\{v^1, ..., v^j\}$
    - A set of constraints $C = \{C^1, ..., C^k\}$​
      - The rules that dicate a relation <u>between variables</u> in $X$​. 
      - Each constraint $C^i$ is a pairing of scope and relation. 

- Examples

  - Graph Coloring Problem

    - Modeling the probelm

      > - Variables $X = \{\text{WA, NT, Q, NSW, V, SA, T}\}$​
      > - Domains $D = \{\text{\{red, green, blue\}}, \text{\{red, green, blue\}}, ... \} $​
      > - Constraints $C = \{\text{SA != WA, SA != NT, SA!= Q, SA!=NSW, SA!=V, WA!=NT, NT!=Q, Q!=NSW, NSW!=V}\}$

  - N-Queens Problem

##### 5.2. Solving CSP

- Process

  - States
    - Assignments of variables to values within domain. 
  - Initial State
    - No variables assigned. 
  - Action
    - Assign a value to any unassigned variable, provided it does not violate a constraint. 
    - If no legal assignments, return **failure**. 
  - Goal Test
    - All variables are assigned values, satisfying all constraints. 

- Algorithm

  - Challenge
    - Reducing the number of states (assignments) explored (so to reduce the complexity of the algorithm). 
      - Complete search tree is only of depth $n$​ variables. *i.e., one layer of the tree for each assignment*. 
      - But if there are $m$ possible values *(i.e., domain size)*, leading to $n! xm^n$ paths through the tree. 
  - Backtracking Search
    - Pseudo code
    - It is a variation of *Depth-First-Search*
      - Single-variable assignments
      - For-each assignment. 

- Optimization

  - Improving assignment methods

    - Most constrained variable

      - Choose the <u>**variable** with the fewest legal values</u>. 
      - Minimum remaining values (MRV) heuristic. 

    - Most constraining variable

      - Assign this variable <u>with the most constraint **value** on the remaining values for other variables.</u>

        > i.e. The value that most constraining for other variables. 

  - Detecting failure early

    - Keep track of remaining legal values for unassigned variables. 
      - Terminate search when any variable has no legal values.
    - **Forward checking** propagates information for assigned to unassigned variables. 
      - Forward checking only detects constraints *early*. 
      - Constraint propagation enforces constraints.
