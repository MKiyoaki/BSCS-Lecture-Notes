#### 14. HTTP Content Negotiation

###### ***Theorem 14.1.*** The Concept of Content Negotiation

- Definition

  - HTTP provides the machanisms for content negotiation, i.e., arriving at an acceptable choice of exactly which representation is delivered to the client. 
  - Gnerally two types: **server-driven** and **agent-driven**. 

- Aim

  >Resource "Representation" is
  >
  >- Information that intended to reflect a **state** of that resource. 
  >- Information in a format that can be communicated via HTTP. 
  >
  >Resource can potentially be represented in
  >
  >- different formats, 
  >
  >- different languages, or
  >
  >- different encodings. 

  - Statisfy the requirements from the users or clients on:

    - different preferences (audio delivery), 

    - capabilities (display text only), or

    - characteristics (visualise low resolution images). 

    - HTTP provides mechanisms for content negotation between client and server. 

###### ***Theorem 14.2.*** Server-Driven Negotiation (Proactive Negotiation)	

>e.g.
>
>```mermaid
>sequenceDiagram
>	Client ->> Server: HTTP Request <br>/url text/html <br>Accept: text/html <br>Accept-Language: en
>	Server --) Resources: find resouces matching <br> /url, text/html, application/json, en
>	Resources --) Server: select resource (loc1)
>	Server ->> Client: HTTP 200 OK <br>Content-Location: loc1 <br>Content-Type: text/html <br>Content-Language: en <br>(Payload: <<rep1>>)
>```

- Definition

- Steps

  1. Clients can express their preferences using specific http header fields.

     >Accept
     >
     >Accept-Charset
     >
     >Accept-Encoding
     >
     >Accept-Language

  2. In response, servers select a representation among those that are available. 

  3. A client cannot rely on negotiation preferences being consistently honored, since the server might:

     - not support negotiation for the requested resource, or

     - decide that sending a response that doesn't conform to the client’s preferences is better than sending a *406 (Not Acceptable) response*. 

- Evaluation

  - Disadvantages

    - It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what might be "best" for any given user, since that would require complete knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent and the intended use for the response (e.g., does the user want to view it on screen or print it on paper?)
    - Having the user agent describe its capabilities in every request can be both very inefficient (given that only a small percentage of responses have multiple representations) and a potential risk to the user's privacy, 
    - It complicates the implementation of an origin server and the algorithms for generating responses to a request, and,
    - It limits the reusability of responses for shared caching

  - Conclusion

    - Server-driven negotiation <u>doesn't scale well</u>.

      >1. There is **one header per feature** used in the negotiation.
      >
      >2. If you want to use screen size, resolution or other dimensions, a new HTTP header must be created.
      >
      >3. Sending of the headers must be done on every request.
      >
      >4. This is not too problematic with few headers, 
      >
      >   but with the eventual multiplications of them, the **message size would lead to a decrease in performance**.
      >
      >5. The more precise headers are sent, the more entropy is sent, 
      >
      >   allowing for more HTTP fingerprinting and corresponding privacy concern.

###### ***Theorem 14.3.*** Agent-Driven Negotiation (Reactive Negotiation)

>e.g.
>
>```mermaid
>sequenceDiagram
>	Client ->> Server: HTTP GET Request /url
>	Note right of Server: Find representations for /url <br>[Server's Options]
>	Server ->> Client: HTTP 300 Multiple Choice <br>[Server's Options for /url]
>	Client ->> Server: HTTP GET Request /url <br> [Client's Selected Perference <br> amongst Server's pptions]
>	Note right of Server: find represent matching <br>[Client's Selected Perference]
>	Server ->> Client: HTTP 200 OK <br>[Server representation matching Client's perfernece]
>```

- Definition
  - When facing an ambiguous request, the server sends back a page containing links to the available alternative resources.
  - The client is presented the resources and choose the one to use.
- Evaluation
  - Conlusion
    - The HTTP standard does not specify the format of the page allowing to choose between the available resource, which prevents to easily automatize the process. 
    - One more request is needed in order to fetch the real resource, <u>slowing the availability of the resource</u> to the user.

#### 15. Web Structure beyond Client and Server

###### ***Theorem 15.1.*** Arthitectures

- Client -Server

  - Client - May use caches to reuse previously retrieved representations when legitimate. 
    - Includes household applications, stereos, scales, firmware update scripts, command-line programs, mobile apps, and communication devices. 
  - Server - Offer uniform API. 
    - Includes browers/websites, home automation units, configurable networking components, office machines, autonomous robots, news feeds, traffic cameras, ad selectors, video-delivery platforms. 

- Intermediary

  - Defintion
    - `Intermediary`
  - HTTP traffic can be interceptedpted by an **internediary**: 
    - Presenting same HTTP uniform API to clients
    - Using a “client-side component” to interact with servers or other intermediary
    - Potentially making use of caching

- Proxy/Gateway

  - Definition

    - `Proxy` - An intermediary that
      1. selected by the client, usually via local configuration rules,
      2. receives requests for URIs, attempts to satisfy those requests via translation through the HTTP interface.
    - `Gateway (reverse proxy)` - An intermediary that
      1. acts as server for the outbound connection, 
      2. but translates received requests and forwards them inbound to another server or servers.

  - Functionality

    - Proxy

      1. Group an organization's HTTP requests **through a common intermediary** for the sake of security, anontation caching. 

         (i.e., Add a layer of caching between client and server & 

         Provide clients with greater anonymity & 

         Filter or transform content, e.g. to translate between languages)

         > e.g. Squid is a caching proxy. 

    - Gateway

      1. Encapsulate legacy or untrusted information services, 

      2. Improve server performance through "accelerator" **caching**, and

         (i.e., Add a layer of caching between client and server)

      3. Enable partitioning or **load balancing** of HTTP services across multiple machines. 

         (i.e., Perform transparent load-balancing between multiple servers)

###### ***Theorem 15.2.*** Managing Resources

>```mermaid
>stateDiagram-v2
>	[*] --> Exists : create/POST
>	Exists --> Exists: update/PUT
>	Exists --> Exists: read/GET
>	Exists --> [*] : delete/DELETE
>```

- The Web Layer significantly different from the transport and network layers. 

  - The abstracts away from networking and topological issues. 

    > At the same time, network and transport layers significantly affect performance and reliability. 

  - The layer allows the Web architect to think in terms of this general notion of resource. 

  - Resources have a lifecycle, in the sense that they may be *created*, their representation can be *obtained*, they can be *modified*, and they can be *deleted*. 

- CRUD

  > Note: 
  >
  > REST perfers the operations that is **cacheable**, that's why **PUT** is preferred instead of **POST** for modification. 
  
  |   REST   |        Resource        |    Operation     |      HTTP      |
  | :------: | :--------------------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
  |  `POST`  |        Creation        |      Create      |    PUT/POST    |
  |  `GET`   | Obtain representation  | Read (Retrieve)  |      GET       |
  |  `PUT`   |         Modify         | Update (Modify)  | PUT/POST/PATCH |
  | `DELETE` | Delete representations | Delete (Destory) |     DELETE     |
  
  Relevant Analogy: 
  
  - The four basic functions of data storage, *Created*, *Read*, *Update*, and *Delete*, usually abbreviated by CRUD.
  - Similar to the lifecycle steps of a Web Resource.

#### 16. Overview on the REST

###### ***Theorem 16.1.*** REST (Representational State Transfer)

- Definition

  >Note: 
  >
  >- Not all deployments of HTTP will necessarily comply with this resource centric view. 
  >
  >   i.e., **Not all usages** of HTTP are compatible with the HTTP specification or the REST principles. 
  >
  >- REST is intended to capture all of those 
  >
  >- REST is an architectural style that
  >
  >   1. Without hard constraints and strict criteria
  >   1. Subject to a lot of interpretation and discussion
  >

  - `Resource-centric view` - **A mode of thinking** that is strongly encouraged by the HTTP specifications. 
  - `REST` -  An architectural style that encourage resource-centric view as well

- 4 Interface Constraints

  > Whether the representation is in the same format as the raw source, or is derived from the source, remains hidden behind the interface. 

  - REST components communicate
    - <u>by transferring a representation</u> of a resource, 
    - <u>in a format matching one of an evolving set</u> of standard data types, 
    - <u>selected dynamically</u> based on the capabilities, or desires of the recipient and the nature of the resource.
  - Constraints
    1. identification of resources, 
    2. manipulation of resources through representations, 
    3. self-descriptive messages, and, 
    4. hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS).

- Linking & State transfer

  - Enriching Representations with Links

    - As HTTP responses are returned, URIs of related resources and their relations are being returned.

      >e.g. Such related links can be:
      >
      >Embedded in application payload, like
      >
      >>  <a> anchor in html
      >>
      >> <link> in html header
      >>
      >> JSON-LD
      >>
      >> HAL (Hypertext Application Language)
      >
      >Or inserted in HTTP response headers

    - Whatever the approach to provide links, clients use these to decide which next resource to explore

  - State Transfers - At any step, a client is sent a complete “picture” of where it can go next, i.e. its state and transitions. 

    - Server sends representation of the client’s state back to the client. 

    - Server **does not “hold on”** to client’s state. 

    - Possible next state transitions of the client are encoded in hypermedia. 

- HTTP Methods Properties 

  |           | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable |
  | --------: | :--: | :--------: | :-------: |
  |     `GET` |  ✅   |     ✅      |     ✅     |
  |    `HEAD` |  ✅   |     ✅      |     ✅     |
  |    `POST` |      |            | ✅ (rare)  |
  |     `PUT` |      |     ✅      |           |
  |  `DELETE` |      |     ✅      |           |
  | `OPTIONS` |  ✅   |     ✅      |           |

  | `CONNECT` |      |            |           |
  |   `TRACE` |  ✅   |     ✅      |           |

  > Safe ~ Read-Only
  >
  > Idempotent ~ Repeatable with same effect
  >
  > Cacheable ~ Response can be cached

###### ***Theorem 16.2.*** State Analysis

- Atomic increment (POST) vs. Non-atomic update (PUT)

  - POST - Send a request for several times will <u>create multiple URLs on the server.</u> 
  - PUT - Send a request for several times will <u>be counted as a single request modification.</u>

- Web Session - a series of contiguous actions by a visitor on an individual website within a given time frame. 

  - During an anonymous session: 

    - Shopping cart is maintained

    - Browsing history (breadcrumbs) is maintained

    - Pages are personaised 

      > e.g.
      >
      > ranking by prices, adverts are targeted to profile, etc. 

  - During an non-anonymous session: 

    - Shopping history is retrieved
    - User preferences are made explicit

- HTTP Cookie

  >e.g. 
  >
  >```mermaid
  >sequenceDiagram
  >	Client ->> Server: HTTP GET Request /path
  >	Note right of Server: Check presence of Cookie header
  >	Server ->> Client: HTTP 200 OK Response <br> Set-Cookie: session-id=12345;
  >	Note left of Client: Subsequent requests to <br> same domain include cookie
  >	Client ->> Server: HTTP Get Request /path <br> Cookie: session-id=12345;
  >	Note right of Server: Customize response <br> according to session's state
  >	Server ->> Client: HTTP ...
  >	
  >```

  - Definition

    - `HTTP cookie` - A smaller piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. 

      > The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the smaller server. 

  - Aim

    - Used to tell if two requests came from the same browser. 
    - It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

  - Applications

    - Session management

      > Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember

    - Personalization

      > User preferences, themes, and other settings

    - Tracking

      > Recording and analysing user behaviour

  - Cookie law - privacy legislation that requires websites to get consent from visitors to store or retrieve any information on a computer, smartphone or tablet.

    > All websites own in the EU or targeted towards EU citizens are now expected to comply with the law.

  - Cookie and REST

    - Cookies typically contain an array of user- specific configuration choices, or a token to be matched against the server’s database on future requests
    - The problem is that a cookie is defined as being attached to any future requests, usually encompassing an entire site
    - Issue: cookie not associated with the particular application state
    - When the browser’s history functionality (the “Back” button) is subsequently used to back-up to a view prior to that reflected by the cookie, the browser’s application state no longer matches the stored state represented within the cookie.
    - Therefore, the next request sent to the same server will contain a cookie that misrepresents the current application context, leading to confusion on both sides.

#### 17. Cross-Cutting Concerns

###### ***Theorem 17.1.*** Naming 

> See ***Theorem 11.2.*** 

###### ***Theorem 17.2.*** Session/State

- REST (Representational State Transfer)
  - Resources are stateful
  - HTTP is stateless
  - Client and Server exchange resource representations
- HTTP exploits the connection oriented natural of TCP
- Web session
  - Definition - An application concept. 
  - Mechanism to manage state of web sessions: 
    - Cookies
    - Client Web Storage
  - Clients and servers maintain state of Web applications
  
    > Many requirements, sometimes contradicting (privacy, auditability, persistence, REST)
