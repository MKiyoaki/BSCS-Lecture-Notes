#### 14. HTTP Content Negotiation

***Theorem 14.1.*** The Concept of Content Negotiation

- Resource

  - "Representation"
    - Information that intended to reflect a **state** of that resource. 
    - Information in a format that can be communicated via HTTP. 

  - Can potentially be represented in
    - different formats, 
    - different languages, or
    - different encodings. 

  - Users or clients may have:
    - different preferences (audio delivery), 
    - capabilities (display text only), or
    - characteristics (visualise low resolution images). 

- HTTP provides mechanisms for content negotation between client and server. 

***Theorem 14.2.*** Server-Driven Negotiation (Proactive Negotiation)

- Clients can express their preferences using specific http header fields.

  >Accept
  >
  >Accept-Charset
  >
  >Accept-Encoding
  >
  >Accept-Language

In response, servers select a representation among those that are available. 

A client cannot rely on negotiation preferences being consistently honored, since the server might:

- not support negotiation for the requested resource, or
- decide that sending a response that doesn't conform to the client’s preferences is better than sending a 406 (Not Acceptable) response. 

***Theorem 14.3.*** Agent-Driven Negotiation (Reactive Negotiation)
