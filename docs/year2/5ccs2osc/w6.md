### 14. The address-binding problem

> Ref:

> [Address-binding in OS - javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/address-binding-in-operating-system)

##### 14.1. Introdcution

1. Definition

  - Virtual Memory Address

    - The memory address that is used by the program. 

      > Reasons for Virtual Memory
      >
      > - Since if CPU operates on the physical directly, and if two programs overlape a same memory address, <u>it is impossible to run the two programs at the same time</u>.
      > - Defining virtual memory will allocate each process a group of virtual memory addresses, so to address with this issue.

  - Physical Memory Address

    - The actual address that stores the program in the hardware. 

2. The address-binding problem

  - Problem when creating the virtual memory in the OS. 
     1. The OS requirment - efficiently, reliable, securely
        - Each process requires the illusion of its own computer, including its own memory. 

        - Be *reliable* and *securely*, i.e., the OS need to prevent one process from accessing another's memory, need to protect the process if the user of another process is malicious. 

     2. Problem with starting address allocation
          - Multiple processes cannot all start from the address of 0. 
     3. Problem with memory address reference
          - Machine instructions (program text) may refer some absolute address of the memory, but the run-time memory addresses might be different from the addresses in the instructions. 

  - Goal
    - How can programs be written as, considering the following points
      - if the memory is private to themselves
      - concrete instructions referencing specific memory addresses, but still executed in a share of physical memory
      - efficiently, reliably, securely


##### 14.2. Simple approach to solve

1. Non-solutions

     - avoid multiprogramming - Keep only one program in memory

       > e.g., like the earliest (non-multiprogrammed) batch computers.

       - Forgoes much potential efficiency and functionality
       - Context switching all of memory to/from disk is unworkably slow


     - statically assign address ranges to programs

       - Cannot handle multiple instances of the program
       - The memory cost of each program could be different
       - Causes unworkable *fragmentation* - Every program that might run needs space reserved at all times


2. Load-time relocation
     - Process
       - Load the programs from the disk to the memory
       - At the same time, rewrite their references to memory


  - Evaluation
    - **Fault isolation** - ‚ùå
      - One incompetent process could trash another's memory, 
      - Or the OS's memory. 
    - **Security** - ‚ùå
      - One malicious process could trash or *read* another‚Äôs memory 
      - Worse: physical address space often also includes *devices*
    - **Rewriting** - ‚ùå
      -  It might be slow to do rewriting
    - **Fragmentation** - ‚ùå
      - Memory can get *fragmented* in two ways:
        - Internally - to a process 
        - Externally - over all memory
      - Reasons
        - If the relocated processes coexisting, the physical address space can be shared among processes, but the processes <u>are different sizes</u>. 
        - **Contiguous** allocation will be a problem.

3. Base and limit registers - **memory management unit (MMU)**

     - MMU

       > It is just a concept, sicne it is integrated into modern CPUs in reality.

       >[![mmu-mz.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/132972/images/c5a/65b/749/1553191632042.jpg)](https://microchip.wdfiles.com/local--files/32bit:mz-arch-memory-address-translation/mmu-mz.png)
       >
       >> - The OSs provide a mechanism for mapping the *virtual addresses* of different processes to the *physical addresses* from the different memories. 
       >> - The virtual addresses of the processes will be translated by the <u>mapping relation from MMU</u> into the physical addresses. Then the OS could access the memory from the physical addresses.

       - Each memory access is checked against *base* and *limit* by the hardware
         - Check fails lead to
           - a hardware interrupt
           - OS kills the process (probably)
         - Set *base* and *limit*
           - privileged instructions
           - only work in *kernel mode*
       - A *system call* - will save and reset (restore on return), just like other registers
       - A *context switch* - will save and to be restored later,  just like other registers


     - Evaluation

       - **Fault isolation** - ‚úÖ
       - **Security **- ‚úÖ
       - **Rewriting **- ‚úÖ
       - **Fragmentation **- ‚ùå
         - Still, memory can get *fragmented* in two ways:
           - Internal - if base and limit must stay fixed
           - External - maybe the OS could support growing processes on demand


##### 14.3. Address Translation

1. Definition

  - Address translation methods

    - Used to manage the relation between virtual and physical addresses. 

      > Like some kinds of allocation methods, as the CPU get a virtual address, it could access the corresponding physical address by these methods. 

    - Two methods: **segementation** and **page tables**. 

  - **Segmentation**

    - Segement the programs into various logic parts, different parts have different properties so they can be devided. 

  - **Paged Virtual Addressing**

    - Paging the whole virtual and physical memory space into fixed size of spaces, in order to <u>address the issue of fragmentation from segmentation</u>. 

2. Comparison

  | Segments                                | Pages                                     |
  | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | any size (up to some max)               | fixed size *(e.g. 4kB)*                   |
  | start anywhere (or almost...)           | are aligned *(e.g. to a multiple of 4kB)* |
  | usually form a coherent unit            | usually an arbitrary division             |
  | external fragmentation                  | **NO** external fragmentation             |
  | **LITTLE or NO** internal fragmentation | internal fragmentation (up to page size)  |
  | fairly simple MMU                       | fairly complex MMU *(need a TLB)*         |
  | virt. addr. space is non-linear         | virtual address space is linear           |
  | sometimes addressed implicitly          | always addressed explicitly               |
  | good for small-word-size machines       | need a larger word size (usu. ‚â•32-bit)    |

##### 15.1. Mechanism of Segmentation

1. Definition

  - **Segment** - Segments are *finer-grained logical chunks* of memory, each can be represented as a *(base, limit)* pair. 

    > Note: *(base, length)* is slightly more usual than *(base, limit)*

    - If an MMU can work with many *(base, limit)* pairs, it *supports* segmentation.

    - Some hardware can <u>enforce permissions</u> on segments. Permission bits are <u>stored alongside base and length</u>. 

      > e.g. can't write to a text segment, can't execute a stack segment, etc. 

2. Mechanism

  - In segementation, <u>a complete virtual address contains **a segment selector and an offset**</u>, *i.e., a pair $(s, o)$.*
    - Usually, a program only needs to specify the offset. But counterexamples exist. *e.g., x86 has segment override forms*. 

    - **Segment selector** - A 16-bit data that is stored in a segment register. 

      - Contains a 13-bit segment number, that forms the index for segment table. 

        > Segment table also contains other information, like the base address, the priority, etc. Virtual address is mapped to physical address via the segment table. 
    - **Offset** - A value between 0 to the max value of the segment. Used to get the physical address. 

  - Steps

    1. The segmentation will devide the virtual address of a program into 4 segments
    2. Find the *base address* of each segments from the segment table (by MMU), with adding the value of offset could get the corresponding physical memory address. 

3. Implicitly selecting segments

  - Instructions that refer to memory usually are intended to work with <u>only one kind of memory</u>, including, 

    - stack, 
    - code, or
    - other data.

  - On a segmented machine we can say each instruction has a **default segment**. 

    > e.g., a jump would jump within the text segment.

  - This is handy for *extending the address space* of small-word-size machines. 

    > e.g. a 16-bit machine naturally gets multiple 64kB segments.

##### 15.3. Evaluation on Segmentation

1. Properties

  - Different processes have <u>different segments</u>. Since processes should have their own private memory.

    > i.e., (code segment, offset 42) in *process A* **IS NOT EQUAL WITH** the same in *process B*

  - Segmented address spaces properties

    - Segments may be <u>different sizes</u>.

      > e.g., In a small segment, `offset 0xfffffff` does NOT exist

    - Segments may <u>overlap</u>. *Aliasing* can complicate both hardware and software. 

      > i.e., They are still defined <u>just by base and limit in physical memory</u>. 

2. Evaluation

  - **Fault isolation** - ‚úÖ
    - Can still catch one process trampling another's memory. 
    - Protection is spatially finer-grained and can have permissions. 
    - Also protect a process from itself to an extent. 
    
  - **Security** - ‚úÖ
    - Also benefit from finer-grained protection. 
    - *Process A* can **NOT** even refer to the private memory of *process B*
    
  - **Rewriting** - ‚úÖ
    - Instructions are (implicitly or explicitly) segment-relative
    - So address-binding is just a matter of creating segments
    
  - **Fragmentation** - ‚ùì
    
    - Internal - no problem. Can have many segments, each any size.
    - External - ‚ùå still a problem. Need *contiguous physical memory*
    
      - Can be addressed with **Memory swap**. 
    
        > i.e., Swap the segments via using the space of disks so to make sure the segments are continous. 
    
      - However, memory swap can be not effective. Since accessing disks is not effective.

### 16. Memory Paging

>Ref:
>
>[‰∏ÄÊñáÂ∏¶‰Ω†‰∫ÜËß£ÔºåËôöÊãüÂÜÖÂ≠ò„ÄÅÂÜÖÂ≠òÂàÜÈ°µ„ÄÅÂàÜÊÆµ„ÄÅÊÆµÈ°µÂºèÂÜÖÂ≠òÁÆ°ÁêÜ - Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/451736494?utm_psn=1745669391663087617)

##### 16.1. Paged virtual addressing

1. Definition

  - **Frame** - A division of *physical address space*, which is <u>continous</u> and with the <u>same size</u>. 

    - A physical address, in binary, can be broken into
      - a **frame number** $f$ - the upper bits
      - an **offset** $o$‚Äã - the lower bits
    - Divide all of memory that starting from 0. 

  - **Page** - A frame-sized division of *virtual address space*. 

    > In Linux, each page has a size of **4kB**. 

    - Pages are built as a mapping of physical frames. <u>A **page** is a mapped frame.</u> 

2. Mechanism

  - Programs use only virtual addresses <u>contains **a page number and an offset**</u>, *i.e., a pair of $(p, o)$*. 
  - Processes deal in virtual addresses and must be translated *at run time*. Each process gets its own virtual address space, contains <u>a **page table** that mapping pages to frames</u>. 
    - A **page table** is just (conceptually) an array of *page table entries*
  - MMU for paging
    - CPU could get the physical directly from the MMU. 
    - Components
      - **PTBR** - **page table** base register
      - **TLB** - translation lookaside buffer (a kind of cache)
  - Steps
    1. Devide the virtual memory address into page number and offset,
    2. Check the page table to get the physical page number, *i.e., frame number $f$‚Äã*. 
    3. Get the physical memory address by adding $f$ and the offset $o$.

##### 16.2. Evaluation on Paging

1. Properties

  - Same-sized units
    - Avoids external fragmentation. 
    - Contiguous *virtual* areas need not be contiguous *physically*
  - Small frame-size
    - Limits internal fragmentation, but does NOT eliminate it.

2. Evaluation - two problems

  - Need one more time of Memory accessing ‚ùå

    1. Lookup in page table for address translation
    2. Get the actual access we wanted to do.

    >Segmentation need only once, because usually the CPU could get the segment selector directly from the register. 

    - Can be addressed by adding a hardware cache of page table to the MMU. 

  - Page tables use up a lot of memory, especially when there are multiple processes ‚ùå

    - Can be addressed by the multi-level page tables. 

##### 16.3. Multi-level Page Tables

1. Calculating the page table size

  >e.g.
  >
  >Considering in a 32-bit environment, the virtual memory space is 4GB. Assume a page has a size of 4KB (i.e., $2^{12}$ bits), then will need $2^5 \times 4 \times 2^{12}=2^{20}$‚Äã (around 1M) pages, each page needs a length of 4-bytes to store the data. 
  >
  >So a 4GB space mapping will occur 4MB memory to store the page tables. 
  >
  >e.g.
  >
  >Considering a flat page table, that could be considerred as a one big long array, with one entry per page. Assume each page is $n$-bit wide and there are $2^n$ pages, each entry (PTE) is $m$‚Äã bytes, then the size of the page table is $m \times 2^n$.
  >
  >Assume $m=4$ (i.e., 32-bit) and $n=20$, the size of the table is $4 \times 2^{20}$

2. PTLR (page table length register)

  - Idea - Keep page table *flat* but limit its *length*
  - Process
    - Allocate a short page table initially, grow it on demand by updating PTLR. 
    - Entries *beyond* PTLR are implicitly invalid.
  - Evaluation
    - virt. addr. space must be *contiguous* ‚ùå
      - Not follow with 'stack grows down, heap grows up', as there are two independently growable areas.
    - growing the PT requires contiguous *physical* memory ‚ùå
      - Exist external fragmentation. 

3. Multi-level Page Tables

  > ![linear page table](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring13/cs111/scribe/15b/2-level_page_table.jpg)
  >
  > > An example of 2-level page table. 

  - Idea - Create a tree of fixed depth (hardware is not recursive).

  - Process (of 2-level page tables)

    - Devide the initial page table into $2^{10}$ first-level page tables, and devide each first-level page tables into $2^{10}$ second-level tables. 
    - Together the first-level page number, the second-level page number and the offset combined as the whole virtual address.

    > Note: On modern 64-bit architectures, the OS will usually use 4-level schemes. (PGD, PUD, PMD, PTE)

  - Evaluation

    - Space used could be less
      - If a first-level page is not used, then the system will not need to create the second-level pages. So it will reduce the used space.
    - Performance could be slower - depends on the TLB (content-associative memory)
      - TLB is the MMU's *cache* of page table entries, storing the *recently used* translations
      - Like any cache, a TLB lookup may *hit* or *miss*
      - The more levels, the slower it is to look up a page translation. So TLB performance becomes increasingly critical.
    - The number of levels needed depends on
      - the size of the virtual address space
      - the size of a page (i.e. how many bits are in *p* vs *o*)
