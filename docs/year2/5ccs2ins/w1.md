###### ***Theorem 1.1.*** Network Layer

> Application - Web - Transport - **Network** - Network Interface
>
> ↕️ *physical layer delivery* ↕️
>
> Application - Web - Transport - **Network** - Network Interface

- Internet Protocol

  - `Internet Protocol(IP)` - A kind of protocol or regulations with the following functionality: 

    - **Route datagrams** between two network interfaces. 

    - Fragment datagrams according to physical layer characteristics. 

  - `IP address` - An unique identifier that is allocated to the devices that connected with the Internet. 

    >A communcation protocol that combined with IP will decide how to deal with the datagrams after receiving them. The most common protocols are `TCP` and `UDP`. 

- Network Layer - **Enable data to traverse any kind of network**

  - `Computer network` - network of devices
  - `Host` - device connected to wired or wireless networks by <u>network interface controllers</u>
  - `Router` - device connected to multiple networks by <u>using multiple network interface controllers</u>
  - `Local area network (LAN)` - *typically < 1km*
  - `Wide area network` - *typically covers wide area, may involve lease lines*
  - Topology
    - `Incomplete graph` - not all nodes are connected
    - `Directed graph` - *✅ student can access kcl but ❌ kcl cannot access student*

###### ***Theorem 1.2.*** IP Address Naming

- MAC address

  - `Network Interface Controller (NIC)` - A computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network. Be uniquely identified by a MAC address (hardware) and a 32-bit IP address (network). 

  - `MAC address (Media Control Address)` - **unique identifier for NIC**, printed in hardware for network interface controller

  - 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits, i.e., 48 bits. 

    Manufacturers have a range of address

    > e.g. Range for MS
    >
    > <u>00:15:5D</u>:<u>00:00:00</u> - 00:15:5D:FF:FF:FF 
    >
    > <u>Organizationally Unique Identifier</u> : <u>Manufacturer specific</u>

  - *MAC address* only used for <u>communication in physical layer</u>

- Host/Domain names for human consumption

  - `Domain name system(DNS)`

- IPv4 Address

  - `IPv4 address` **identifies the network interface** of a device over the Internet

    > A device may have multiple addresses

  - **32 bits** long - 4,294,967,296 addresses as maximum

    > Notation: 4 bytes separated by dots, each byte in range [0, 255]
    >
    > e.g. 137.73.113.232

    - $n$ bits prefix + $32-n$ bits suffix

      All hosts in a network **share the same network prefix**

      > e.g. 
      >

      > Network prefix + Host suffix

    - Notation: Taking IPv4 address <u>137.73.113.232/24</u>  as an example

      - `Subnet mask` 24

        > > 8 (i.e. $32-n$) bits Identify the host computer

        > *137.73.113.232/<u>24</u>* implies that in 32-bit binary foramt, there are continous 24 times of '1', i.e., *<u>255.255.255.0</u>*. An alternative expression is *137.73.113.232/<u>255.255.255.0</u>*

      - `Network address` 137.73.113.0

      - `Broadcast address` 137.73.113.255

      - `Number of addresses` 256

      - `Number of hosts` 254

    - Computation

      - Number of addresses on network is $2^{32-n}$

        > 2 reserved addresses: 
        >
        > - Network address (suffix set to 0s)
        > - Broadcast address (suffix set to 1s)

      - Number of host addresses is $2^{32-n}-2$

  - Special IPv4 address

    - Loopback address  `127.0.0.0/8`

      > For the software loopback interface of a machine - used for testing application or websites. 
      >
      > Not physically connected to a network.
      >
      > `127.0.0.1` is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic. 

    - Private addresses `10.0.0.0/8`

      > NAT (Network address translation allow for private addresses to communicate with remote hosts over the Internet)

    - Private addresses `192.168.0.0/16`

    - Broadcast `255.255.255.255/32`

- IPv6 Address

  - `IPv6 address` Internet standard since 2017

  - **128 bits** long - $2^{128}$ as maximum number of addresses

    - Notation: colon hexadecimal notation

      8 sections of 2 bytes each, each section noted with 4 hexadecimal digits

      > e.g.

      > Network prefix (network location) + Interface ID (unique identifier)

      `Netmask` **64 leftmost bits** (4 sections) = `Network address` 48 bits + `Subnet address` 16 bits

      `Device address` **64 rightmost bits** (4 sections)

      > Different from IPv4, IPv6 could store the information of the subnet directly inside the address

- Governance 

  - IP Address space is managed by *Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)*. 

  - *IANA* delegates allocations of IP address blocks to *Regional Internet Registries (RIR)*, themselves allocates blocks of addresses to organisations and users. 

    > AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC
    
  - Hierarchy allows for decentralised and localised name management.

#### 2. Network Layer and Routing

> ref:

> [What is Routing - CLOUDFLARE](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/)

###### ***Theorem 2.1.*** IP Message

- Definition

  > (**Transport** Data)
  >
  > *⬇️ Encapsulation*
  >
  > [IP Header + (IP Data)]
  >
  > *⬇️ Encapsulation*
  >
  > {Frame Header + [Frame Data]}

  - `IP Message` or `datagram` or `packet` - A basic transfer unit associated with a pakcet-switched network. Consits by the following components: 
    - header
    - data contents - provided by the transport layer (TCP) or other protocols. 
  - `Payload` - The full IP Message (Header + data) which is for the layer below. 

![Internet Protocol version 4 - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/IPv4_Packet-en.svg/1200px-IPv4_Packet-en.svg.png)

###### ***Theorem 2.2.*** IP Datagram Header

- Definition
  - `IP Header` - Contains information about IP for addressing and routing. 
  
- Component (of IPv4 Header)

  - A mandatory section of **20 bytes**, including: 

    - The **source** and **destination address** (both are 32 bits) of the message. 

      > **Source** is identified for error or ack messages to be returned back

    - **Total Length** (16 bits) defines the entire packet size in bytes (header + data). 

    - **Protocol** (8 bits) specifies the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram. 

    - **Time to Live (TTL)** (8 bits) to avoid forwarding messages infinitely in a loop

      > i.e., TTL field is an integer in range [0, 255]
      >
      > Whenever a message is forwarded, its TTL value is decreased. 
  
    - Other information...
  
  - An optional section of the same length
  
  Therefore, the <u>minimum size of a header is 20 bytes</u> (without data) and the <u>maximum size</u> is 65,535 bytes (i.e., $2^{16}-1$).  

###### ***Theorem 2.3.*** IP Routing

- Definition
  - `IP Routing` - the route that transferring the datagrams from the source address to their destintation address. 

- Components

  - Routing tables

    > Checking it by `netstat -r` on MacOS

    - `Destination` - network or host
    - `Gateway` - the next-hop intermediary *via which packets should be routed*
    - `Genmask` - network mask for destination
    - `Iface` - network controller interface

  - Forwarding algorithm - Use routing tables to forward incoming messages/datagrams to their next hop. 

  - Routing protocol - **Generate and maintain** dynamic routing tables. 

    - Routing within administrative domain

    - Routing between administrative domains

#### 3. Fragmentation and Diagnostics

###### ***Theorem 3.1.*** Fragmentation

- Definition

  > Due to the existence of MTU, for network with smaller MTU, a datagram needs to be divided in smaller packets, each with a size smaller than MTU. 
  >
  > > e.g.
  > >
  > > For Ethernet, MTU is 1500
  > >
  > > Maximum length of an IP datagram is $2^{16}-1=65535$ bytes

  - `Fragmentation` - The operation to divide datagram into smaller packets. 
  - `Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU)` - Maximum size for data field of a packet structure at physical layer. 
  - `IP Fragmented Packet` - The smaller IP packet after being fragmented. 
  - Fragmentation can occur at any router. 

- Reassembly

  > A fragement itself may be fragemented if it is forwardde through a network with a smaller MTU (i.e., if necessary). 

  The reassembly of the datagram is done **by the destination**, as each fragement may be routed by a different path. 

  - Prerequirements

    > Note: IP does not have the capability of requesting a fragment that is missing or corrupted

    - To reassemble fragments, the destination will use *the fragement offset* to determine the order for reassembling fragments. 
    - To reassemble a datagram, all fragments need to **have been delivered**. 

- Header Information

  > Considerring the header of a datagram. It includes the following data: 
  >
  > - `Flag` (3 bits)
  > - `Fragment Offset` (13 bits)
  
  - Structure of a fragment
  
    - Each fragment has its own header.
  
    - Every fragment must be a multiple of 8 bytes (except for the last one). 
  
    - First $n-1$ fragments have MF flag set to 1. 
  
    - Last fragment has MF flag set to 0. 
  
      > e.g. Datagram payload $5560 = 3 * 1480 + 1120$ through a network with a $MTU = 1500$

###### ***Theorem 3.2.*** ICMP & Diagnostics

- Definition

  - `Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)` - Helps determine if a host or route is alive, since Internet Protocol has no mechanism to query.  There are two types of ICMP messages: 
    - `Error reporting` messages - report error situation to the original source
      - Destination unreachable - *Generated by a router to <u>inform the source host</u> that destination address is unreachable*. 
      - Time execeeded - *Generated by a router when <u>the TTL field in the header is 0</u>*. 
    - `Query` messages
      - **Echo-request** & **Echo-reply** - *determine whether two systems <u>can communicate</u> with each other*. 
      - **Timestamp-request** & **Timestamp-reply** - *determine the <u>round-trip time</u> needed for an IP datagram to travel between hosts*. 

- Exploitation to the key messages
  - PING 
    - PING Utility
    
      > Host/Router = send ping_echo_request => Host/Router
      >
      > Host/Router <= listen ping_echo_response = Host/Router
      >
      > Estimate round-trip time in ms. 
    
    - PING Messages
    
  - Traceroute - A diagnostic tool that tracks the pathway of a packet on netwrk from source to destination. 

    - Traceroute Utility - Sends UDP messages with increasing TTL values

      > When a router receives a message with TTL=1, it descards it and send back an ICMP Time exceeded message. 
      >
      > When the destination receives the UDP at an unexpected port, it responds with an ICMP Host Unreachable.

#### 5. Crossing-Cutting Concerns

###### ***Theorem 5.1.*** Naming

> See ***Theorem 1.2.***

###### ***Theorem 5.2.*** Session/State

- IP
  - connection-less protocol (packet switched)
  - IP is an entirely connectionless, best effort, unreliable message-delivery service
- Datagrams
  - are routed independently
  - do not require a connection to be set up
  - are not persisted in the IP layer beyond the first delivery attempt for each router (no re-retry)
  - No management of the packets already received, or still to receive.
- Naming

###### ***Theorem 5.3.*** Properties

>  Generally, IP not a self-described layer. It has limited querying capability through ICMP. 

- [Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4301)

  > e.g. IP address spoofing, Denial spoffing, Routing attacks...

  - <u>No security in the original IP</u> since packet header and contents are visible. 
  - `IPSec` - A protocol for setting up secure connections over a network. 
    - Mandatory feature of **IPv6**. 
    - Often used to for **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**

- Reliability

  - Message Delivery - **Unreliable** (no guarantee about message delivery)
    - Messages may arrive corrupted, out of order, duplicated or be lost. 
    - No notification of delivery failure
  - Network
    - Redundancy in network allows potential alternate routes for message delivery
    - Resilience of network as links go down
  
- Scalability

  - Size

    > The evoluation from IPv4 to IPv6 - because of the capacity of IPv4 is not enough. 

    - IPv4 lifetime was extended because of technologies such as NAT. 
    - IPv6 has a much wider range of addresses. 

  - Bandwidth

    - **Redundancy in network** allows potential alternate routes for message delivery. 
    - Resilience of network as links go down. 

- Management
  - Names
    - Hierarchical network structure allows for decentralized management. 
    - `Network administrators` are responsible for allocating IP addresses within a block of addresses. 
    - `DHCP` - Protocol for dynamic management 
  - Topology - Ability to add and remove networking links.
    - Routers to be configured, and routing protocols allows for dynamic updates. 

- Governance (see ***Concept 1.2.***)

  - *IANA*
