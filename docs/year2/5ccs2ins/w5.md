###### ***Theorem 18.1.*** End-to-end encryption

- Definition
  - `End-to-end encryption`
    - A method of communication where <u>only the communicating parties can read</u> the information being exchanged. 
    - Aims to <u>prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attack</u>.
  
  - `SSL (Secure Socket Layer)` - an encryption-based Internet security protocol
    - developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. 
  
  - `TLS (Transport Layer Security)` - the encryption that tsupersede SSL / A more powerful SSL
    - Aims: 
      - Authentication
        - the server side of the channel is always authenticated
        - the client side is **optionally** authenticated
  
      - Confidentiality
        - Data sent over the channel after establishment is only visible to the endpoints
  
      - Integrity
        - Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot be modified by attackers without detection
  
    - Primary components
      - A **handshake protocol** - See ***Theorem 18.2.*** 
      - A **record protocol**
  
- Applications

  - HTTPS
    - TLS to secure HTTP traffic constitutes the HTTPS protocol
    - HTTPS uses port 443 (rfc2818)
    - URIs can use HTTP and HTTPS schemes
  
  - Secure mail
    - The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)` can also be protected by TLS
  
  - VPN
    - TLS can also be used for tunnelling an entire network stack to create a VPN, which is the case with OpenVPN and OpenConnect
  
  - DoH/DoT
    - `DNS` - the phone book of the Internet (mapping domain names to IP addresses)
    - `DoH` - DNS over HTTPS (port 443)
    - `DoT` - DNT over TLS (port 853)


###### ***Theorem 18.2.*** Handshake protocol - TLS Sequence diagram

- Phases: 

  1. Key exchange
     - Requires TCP 3-way handshake to be completed. 

  2. Server parameters
     - Estabilish other handshake parameters. 

  3. Authentication
     - Authenticate the server and provide key confirmation and handshake integrity.  i.e., Ability for server to sent encrypted data before authentication completes. 

  Then the bidirectional communication is secured. 

- Note

  - In TLS 1.3, it focusing on performance over TLS1.2 and has better cryptography techniques. 
  - TCP connections come with a setup cost
  - TLS handshake adds to it. But it is necessary.

#### 19. Simple HTTP Access Authentication

###### ***Theorem 19.1.*** Authentication & Authorization

> **Authentication** is distinct from **authorization**

- Authentication
  - The process of <u>identifying an individual</u>, often based on a username and password, but also fingerprints
  - Authentication merely ensures that the individual is who he or she claims to be, but says nothing about the access rights of the individual
  - Multi-factor authentication uses additional mechanisms for authentication, e.g. mobile phone
- Authorization
  - The process of <u>granting or denying access to a network resource</u>
  - Most computer security systems are based on a **two-step process**
    1. Authentication, which ensures that a user is who he or she claims to be
    2. Authorization, which allows the user access to various resources based on the user's identity

###### ***Theorem 19.2.*** Basic Authentication

- Request

  - HTTP header field: *Authorization*
  - Basic scheme relies on a base 64 encoding of username/password string. Note that Base64 encoding is reversible. 

  >e.g. 
  >
  >```
  >Userid: user
  >Password: hello
  >Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpoZWxsbw==
  >```

- Response

  - The *401 (Unauthorized) response* message is used by a server to challenge the authorization of a user agent.
  - This response MUST include a **WWW-Authenticate header field** containing at least one challenge applicable to the requested resource.

  >e.g. 
  >
  >```
  >curl -I http://192.168.100.11/
  >HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  >Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
  >Date: Thu, 30 Jul 2020 15:22:39 GMT Content-Type: text/html
  >Content-Length: 188
  >Connection: keep-alive WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="VM Realm"
  >```

###### ***Theorem 19.3.*** Security Considerations

- Security Considerations

  - Vulnerable to dictionary attacks. 
  - Digest Authentication SHOULD be used only with passwords that have a reasonable amount of entropy. 
  - If Digest Authentication is being used, it SHOULD be over a secure channel like HTTPS. 
  - Digest Authentication does not provide a strong authentication. 

- HTTP Digest Access Authentication

  >Client submits *H1*: a hash of username:realm:password ➡️
  >
  >Use cryptography hash, e.g. SHA-256 ➡️
  >
  >Server only needs to keep a copy of *H1* for authorised users, will not store the string of the password directly.

#### 20. Authorization and Identity Frameworks

> ref:
>
> [OpenID Connect - mozilla](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/iam/openid_connect.html)

###### ***Theorem 20.1.*** HTTP Simple Access Authentication

> Note for online identify: 
>
> In the physical world, organisations have processes to check user’s identity and issue “identity cards”. 🪪
>
> In the online world, users have identity on websites or for enterpries, etc. 

- Machanism

  - The client requests an access-restricted resource on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's credentials. 
  - In order to provide third-party applications access to restriced resources, the resource owner shares its credentials to the third-party. 

- Limitations 

  - Client-side
    - Credentials passed in plain
    - No checking that this is indeed the user
    - No time limit
    - No specific purpose
  - Server-side
    - Makes authorization decision
    - Challenge with the management of sensitive information
    - Compliance with regulations
    - To be repeated with every service

- Motivating scenario

  > An end-user can grant a printing service access to protected photos stored at a photo-sharing service. 
  >
  > End-user should not share username and password with the printing service.
  >
  > Instead, end-user authenticates directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service which issues delegation-specific credentials to the printing service. 

###### ***Theorem 20.2.*** OAuth and OpenID Connect

- Definition

  - `OAuth 2.0` - A standard protocol for authorization
    - <u>Provides specific authorization flows</u> for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.
    - Is developed within the IETF OAuth Working Group. 

  - `OpenID Connect 1.0` - An **identity layer** on top of the OAuth 2.0.
    - Enables Clients to v**erify the identity of the End-Use**r based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server. 
    - Enables Clients to **obtain basic profile information about the End-User** in an interoperable and REST-like manner. 

  - `ID token` - Similar to an identity card signed by the OpenID Provider (OP). 
    - Is represented as a standard **JSON Web Token (JWT)** format,
    - To obtain one, an application needs to redirect the user to their OpenId Provider with an authentication request.
    - Features
      - Asserts the identity of the user (sub).
      - Specifies the issuing authority (iss).
      - Generated for a particular client/*audience* (aud)
      - May contain a nonce (nonce).
      - Has an issue (iat) and expiration time (exp).
      - May include additional requested details about the subject, such as name and email address.
      - Is digitally signed, so it can be verified by the intended recipients.

- Key aspects of the approach

  >Sequence with OpenID Connect
  >
  ><img src="https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/assets/images/OIDC_sequence_diagram.png" alt="OIDC Sequence Diagram" style="zoom:80%;" />
  >
  >1. User connects with App
  >
  >2. User redirected to login page with OpenID Provider
  >
  >   ... potentially via a third-party identity provider
  >
  >3. Single usage token returned by OP
  >
  >4. User callback with single usage token
  >
  >5. App converts the single usage token to identity token and access token
  >
  >6. User granted access by App
  >
  >7. App requests resource access using access token

  - Several variants exist to accommodate real life applications (+ older versions)
  - OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect exploit HTTP interaction patterns (redirects, callbacks, ...)
  - Browser only obtains a single usage token
  - Id Token not visible to the browser, but to App
  - Id Token signed by OP
  - Back channel between RS and OP
  - Revocation possible
  - Permissions support (read v. write)

#### 21. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

###### ***Theorem 21.1.*** The Notion of Origin

- History: Innovations and Challenges

  >1994: the “magic cookie” feature was implemented into Netscape Navigator
  >
  >1995: Netscape introduces JavaScript
  >
  >1995-1997: Netscape defined an API to access HTML elements (Document Object Model: DOM)
  >
  >> Within the scope of the browser, there would need to be a way to securely interact with these entities
  >
  >1995: Netscape introduced the concept of same-origin
  >
  >> The policy was originally designed to protect access
  >>
  >> to the DOM, but has since been broadened to protect sensitive parts of the global JavaScript object

- `Origin` - In web terms, the origin is **a set of common characteristics of a web resource URI**, formed of three elements: 

  > e.g.
  >
  > `http://` `www.example.com:` `8080/`
  >
  > `scheme` `hostname` `port` = `origin`
  >
  > Therefore, all resources identified by *schema:hostname/anything:port* have the same origin. 

  - scheme (protocol)
  - hostname (domain/subdomain) 
  - port

###### ***Theorem 21.2.*** Same Origin Policy

- Same Origin Policy - Browser-based defense mechanism

  >🧭Web Browser =`GET http://example1.org`=> Web Server `http://example1.org` ✅
  >
  >🧭Web Browser =`XMLHttpRequest`=> Web Server `http://example2.org` ❌

  - Permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page <u>if both web pages have the same *origin</u>*

  - Introduced by Netscape Navigator in 1995

- Limitation

  >  Most of the time, a script running in the browser would only need to access resources on the same origin. 
  >
  > e.g. API calls to the same backend that served the JavaScript code in the first place
  >
  > So the fact that JavaScript cannot normally access resources on other origins is a good thing for security. However, there are legitimate scenarios where cross- origin access is desirable/necessary. 
  >
  > In particular, when an API is to be shared by multiple domains

###### ***Theorem 21.3.*** Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CROS)

- Features

  - Defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to **determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request**
  - Allows for **more freedom and functionality** than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests. 

- Three Aspects

  - HTTP Extension - Headers, Request/Response challenge
  - Fetch - Fetch Definition, Browser based policy
  - Preflight - Definition, Protocol

- HTTP Request-response protocol

  - HTTP Request

    The **Origin** request header indicates where a request (specifically a fetch) originates from

    `Origin: http://localhost:3001`

    It does not include any path information, but only the scheme, server name, and port.

  - HTTP Response

    If the recipient of the request accept **Origin**, then response succeeds, with added Response Header:

    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <<origin>>`

    Note that wildcard `*` is allowed

- Preflight Requests

  >e.g.
  >
  >```
  >curl -I -X OPTIONS
  >-H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
  >-H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type"
  >-H "Origin: http://localhost:3001"  http://localhost:3000/with-cors
  >
  >HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
  >Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3001 
  >Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE 
  >Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type 
  >Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length,X-Foo,X-Bar Vary: Origin, Access-Control-Request-Headers 
  >Content-Length: 0
  >Date: Sun, 02 Aug 2020 21:19:00 GMT
  >```

  - Distinguish simple from complex requests

  - Complex requests: **XMLHttpRequest**

    Javascript and HTTP request methods that can modify data (usually HTTP methods other than GET, or for POST usage with certain MIME types)

  - Browsers "preflight" complex request, soliciting supported methods from the server with an HTTP OPTIONS request method

  - Upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method

  - Resource can notify whether ”security credentials" should be sent with requests

- Key aspects of the approach

  - To allow sharing responses cross-origin and allow for more versatile fetches than possible with HTML’s form element, the **CORS protocol** exists.
  - It is layered on top of HTTP and allows responses to declare they can be shared with other origins
  - The decision whether JavaScript is allowed to access foreign domains using **XMLHttpRequest** *is made in the browser*
    - A Resource “cannot protect” itself from arbitrary clients
    - Even a “modified Browser” may not implement CORS

#### 22. Cross-Cutting Concerns 

###### ***Theorem 22.1.*** Features

- Security

  - HTTPS: end-to-end security based on TLS

  - Simple Access Authentication

  - Authorization and Identity

  - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

  - Security Considerations:

    - Many more attacks possible

    - Formal methods required for proving

      correctness of protocols

    - The browser has become a very

      sophisticated software system, itself subject to many potential attacks

- Scalability

  - Protocols have become more involved!
    - HTTPS setup costs
    - OAuth interactions
    - Preflight requests for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

- Governance

  > W3C, IETF, OpenID, WhatWG, EU privacy laws, CAs and browser developers, etc. 

- Description

  - Web layer is self describable:
    - **WWW-Authenticate** header
    - Use of **OPTIONS** and **HEAD** to query service for CORS and Security
