#### 29. Web Services

###### ***Theorem 29.1.*** JSON Schema

- Definition

  - `JSON Schema` - A vocabulary that allows you to <u>annotate and validate JSON documents</u>

    - Defines/answers

      > data types, structure, required data

    - Does not define/answer

      > meaning of data

  - `JSON-based format` - A JSON file with ONLY one element

    >Validating data is useful for: 
    >
    >- Automating tests
    >- Guarantee high quality client-submitted data
    >- Combining different data sources

- Definition

  - `Web services` - Services deployed using internet and web technology for interfaces and communication

  - `Interfaces` - The description of the **protocols supported** by a service are called its interface

  - Service-oriented computing

    Applies principles behind internet and web to **software functionality**:

    - **Decentralised**
    - **Distributed** administration
    - Protocols remain **constant** even if servers change
    - Allows companies to provide, maintain and update proprietary software on their own sites Multiple services can be **combined** to provide a greater product
    - **Extension** of object / component principles

- Interfaces

  > Each service states the **protocols** it supports. The protocols can be **specific** to its business function. The interfaces are used to describe the protocols. 
  >
  > e.g. 
  >
  > A service providing <u>stock quotes for named companies on demand</u> supports <u>a protocol for asking for stock quotes</u>. 

  - **Multiple services** providing interchangeable functionality: can use same interface definition. 

- Evaluation

  - Pros
    - Reusability - 3rd parties or "intra" company
    - Language transparency
    - Usability
    - Deployability
  - Cons
    - Latency - Time between a request and a response
    - Partial failure - Network errors Server "congestion"

###### ***Theorem 29.3.*** SOAP Service

> ```mermaid
> graph LR
> 	r(Service Requestor) <-- Bind --> p(Service Provider)
> 	r <-- find --> rr(Service Registry)
> 	rr <-- Publish --> p
> ```

- Definition

  - `Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP Service)`
    - Service Provider - Systems or application providing Web Service.
    - Service Requester - Systems or applications requesting Web Service from Service Provider.
    - Service Registry - Registry or repository where information about Web Service is provided by the Service Provider. (UDDI Universal Description Discovery and Integration)
  - `Web Services Definition Language (WSDL)` - An XML language for describing services
    - **Specifies the form of messages** a service understands or produces
    - Contains the following major elements
      - `<types>` - Defines the (XML Schema) data types used by the web service
      - `<messages>` - Defines the data elements for each operation
      - `<portType>` - Describes the operations that can be performed and the messages involved
      - `<binding>` - Defines the protocol and data format for each port type

- WSDL interface

  >Service Definition

  >><u>Port Type 1</u>

  >>> > Input Message Format

  >>> > Output Message Format

  >>> <u>Operation 2</u>
  >>>
  >>> > Input Message Format
  >>>
  >>> > Output Message Format

- SOAP common **structure**

  >Envelop
  >
  >> Header
  >
  >> Body
  >
  >> Fault

  - Outer **envelope** containing **header** and **body**
  - Expressed as XML element hierarchy

###### ***Theorem 29.4.*** RESTful Service

>```mermaid
>graph LR
>	c(Service Consumer) --A request in the form of XML or JSON--> p(Service Provider)
>	p --A response in the form of XML or JSON--> c
>```

- Definition

  - `Representational State Transfer (REST)`
  - `Stateless Service` - Web Server does not store any information about the client session

- Evaluation

  - Advantages for RESTful

    - No expensive tools require to interact with the web service
    - Smaller learning curve
    - REST is generally faster and uses less bandwidth
    - Fast (no extensive processing required)
    - Closer to other web technologies in design philosophy
    - REST allows a greater variety of data formats, whereas SOAP only allows XML.
    - REST provides superior performance, particularly through caching for information that’s not altered and not dynamic.
    - It is the protocol used most often for major services such as Yahoo, Ebay, Amazon, and even Google.
    - It’s easier to integrate with existing websites with no need to refactor site infrastructure. This enables developers to work faster rather than spend time rewriting a site from scratch. Instead, they can simply add additional functionality.

  - Advantages for SOAP

    - Language, platform, and transport independent
    - Works well in distributed enterprise environments
    - Standardised
    - Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS standards
    - Built-in error handling
    - Automation when used with certain language products
    - In some cases, designing SOAP services can be less complex compared to REST. For web services that support complex operations, requiring content and context to be maintained, designing a SOAP service requires less coding in the application layer for transactions, security, trust, and other elements.
    - SOAP has tighter security. WS-Security, in addition to SSL support, is a built-in standard that gives SOAP some more enterprise-level security features.

    |                          | SOAP                                                         | REST                                                         |
    | :----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Design**               | Standardized protocol with pre-defined rules to follow.      | Architectural style with loose guidelines and recommendation. |
    | **Approach**             | Function-driven                                              | Data-driven                                                  |
    | **Stateless**            | Stateless by default, but it’s possible to make a SOAP API stateful. | Stateless (no server-side sessions).                         |
    | **Caching**              | API calls <u>cannot</u> be cached.                           | API calls <u>can</u> be cached.                              |
    | **Performance**          | Requires more bandwidth and computing power.                 | Requires fewer resources.                                    |
    | **Transfer protocol(s)** | HTTP, SMTP, UDP, and others.                                 | HTTP *(REST is an architectural style and can be applied to other protocols)* |
    | **Recommended for**      | Enterprise apps, high-security apps, distributed environment, financial services, payment gateways, telecommunication services. | Public APIs for web services, mobile services, social networks. |
    | **Pros**                 | High security, standardized, extensibility.                  | Scalability, better performance, browser-friendliness, flexibility. |
    | **Cons**                 | Poorer performance, more complexity, less flexibility.       | Less security, not suitable for distributed environments.    |
