### 12. General Concepts of Functional Programming

##### 12.1. Introduction

- Definitions
  - **Functional programs**
    - Programs consist entirely of functions.
    - It focus on what to be computed, rather than how it should be computed. 
  - **Functions** - A function can be defined in terms of other functions (previously defined by the programmer, in libraries or language primitives). 
- Features
  - **Strongly-typed** and have built-in memory management. 
    - Pros ✅
      - Shorter programs. 
      - Easier to understand. 
      - Easier to design, verify and maintain than imperative programs. 
    - Cons ❌
      - Usually slower than imperative programs.
      - Arguably less flexible.
- Example - **Haskell**
  - Introduction
    - A modern functional programming language.
    - GHC - Glasgow Haskell Compiler
    - GHCi - GHC interactive environment (interpreter)

##### 12.2. Syntax and Evaluation

- Syntax of Functional Programs

  - Notation

    - The notation is inspired by mathematical definition of functions by using *equations*

      > e.g., `square x = x * x`

  - Execution

    - The computer will evaluate and display the *results of the expressions* that the programmer writes, using the available functions. 

      >e.g., With the input of `square 6` will give a result `36`. 

    - Expressions may contain numbers, variables or names of functions. 

    - Process

      > e.g., 
      >
      > Assume an input `square 6` is received, the computer will
      >
      > 1. Use the definition of the function `square` and replace this expression by `6 * 6`.
      > 2. Use the predefined operation `*`, which will compute and give the result `36`.

      - The process of evaluating an expression is a *simplication process*, also called a *reduction or evaluation*. The goal is to obtain the value or normal form associated with the expression, by a series of reduction steps. 
      - We will use the notation $e \rightarrow e'$, that denotes the reduction from the expression $e$ to the expression $e'$.
      - The *meaning* of an expression is its value.
