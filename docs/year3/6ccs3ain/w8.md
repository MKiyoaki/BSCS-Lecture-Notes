### 8.1. Introduction to Agent Communications Languages (ACLs)

##### 8.1.1. Software Agents

- Motivation
  - Computational devices and systems ara facing rapid evolution, thus software engineering need to be:
    - Robust
    - Designing for system-level properties
    - Living Systems
- Definition
  - A software agent is a computational entity with (some degree of): 
    - Social awareness
    - Proactive behaviour towards defined goals
    - Reactive behaviour in response to its environment
    - Decision-making autonomy.
  - Agents v.s. Objects (Object-Oriented Programming):
    - Agents are autonomous (they are requested to act, not invoked), 
    - A multi-agent system (MAS) has multiple, interacting threads of control, not one.
    - Agents have dynamic relationships with each other, not static.
  - Some applications
    - Agents direct the second economy
- Agenda
  - To architect (design and create) agents, the most common approach is based on the Philosophy of Intention and Rational Agency (Bratman, Pollock). 
  - To architect Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), we need to understand <u>how may agents interact with one another</u>. 

##### 8.1.2. Agent Communications Languages (ACLs)

- Human Languages

  - Functions
    - A means of information transfer
    - A means of co-ordinating joint actions
    - A means of establishing and maintaining social relationships
    - A signalling system
  - Aspects of human languages
    - *Syntax*: its words, phrases, sentences and grammar
    - *Semantics*: what meanings are assigned to the words, phrases & sentences
    - *Pragmatics*: how the words, phrases and sentences are used in conversation.
  - Typology
    - Factual Statements (Propositions), Expressive Statements, Social Connection Statements
    - Commissives, Directives, Inferences
    - Argumentation Statements, Control Statements

- Definition to ACLs

  - A means of communications (as with human languages) between independent, autonumous entities.

    - Functions: information transfer, action co-ordination, social manipulation, signalling.

  - Programming languages for agents to enable software entities to achieve their goals. 

    > e.g. to communicate with other agents. 

  - We expect this could be automated. 

  - Software engineering methods to enable software engineers to achieve their goals. 

    > e.g. for their agents to interact with other agents

  - We desire that the level of abstraction <u>facilitate the S/E task</u>. 

  - Formal Languages

    - Defined Syntax
    - Defined Semantics
    - We desire that properties be known and understood before deployment.

- Proposals

  - Two Major Proposals
    - Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML)
    - IEEE Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents ACL (FIPA ACL)

  - Both ACLs distinguish between two layers of communicated messages:

    - The topics of conversation (which may be represented in a suitable logical language)

    - The utterances which refer to these topics.

      > e.g.
      >
      > query (Is it raining?)
      >
      > inform (It is raining)

##### 8.1.3. FIPA ACL

- Definition

  - IEEE FIPA ACL has **22** *locutions* (types of *utterances*). 

    - Locutions: A group of standardized expressions that used by agents. 

    - Utterances: A language instance that is used by an agent. 


    > e.g.
    >
    > inform, query-if, request, agree, refuse

  - Each has a defined syntax:

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```prolog
    > (inform
    > 	:sender (agent-identifier:name j) 
    > 	:receiver (agent-identifier:name i) 
    > 	:content
    > 		“weather (today, raining)” 
    > 	:language Prolog)
    > 	
    > ```

  - The origins of FIPA ACL are in knowledge-sharing and automated contract negotiations.

- Classification

  - Types
    - Factual statements: 8 locutions
      > e.g. confirm
    - Expressive statements: 1 locution
      > e.g. inform
    - Social connection statements: 1 locution
      > e.g. inform
    - Commissives: 5 locutions
      > e.g. propose
    - Directives: 5 locutions
      > request
    - Inferences: 1 locution
      > inform
    - Argumentation Statements: 0 locution
    - Control Statements: 4 locution
      > e.g. not-understood
  - Conclusion

    - An *absence* of locutions supporting argumentation
    - An overloading of some locutions.

- Evaluation (Some Flaws)

  - As befits a language for knowledge-sharing, the semantics impose sincerity. 
    - For many applications, sincerity is not appropriate (eg, negotiations).

  - As befits a language for contract negotiations, the underlying (implicit) argumentation theory is simplistic. 
    - No ability to argue, to challenge or to justify statements.

  - The absence of an explicit argumentation theory causes a state space explosion. 
  - The language does not readily support self-transformation.
  - The private axiomatic semantics is not verifiable.

### 8.2. Semantics of Agent Communications Languages

##### 8.2.1. Introduction to Semantics

- Purposes

  - To ensure shared understanding of language in communication by
    - agents, their human principals, the software developers of the MAS, the software developers of the participating agents, other stakeholders, etc. 

  - To enable study of formal properties of the language

  - To provide an account of what is happening when an ACL is used

  - To facilitate successful software engineering & implementation.

- Defintion

  - Considerable work on defining semantics of individual utterances.
  - Less work on semantics of dialogues under a given protocol. 
  - Very little work yet on semantics of protocols.
  - Types of semantics (from programming language theory):
    - Axiomatic
    - Operational
    - Game-theoretic
    - Denotational

##### 8.2.2. Axiomatic Semantics

- Definition

  - An axiomatic semantics articulates the *pre-conditions and post-conditions* of an utterance
    - What needs to be true beforehand, and what becomes true aftterwards
  - This is usually done in a formal logical language, such as First-Order Logic or modal logic.

- Semantics

  - FIPA ACL has been given a formal, axiomatic semantics using speech act theory, called *Semantic Language (SL)*. 
  - The speech act semantics SL for FIPA ACL links utterances to the private mental states of the participants
    - Beliefs, Uncertain Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions
    - This semantics has been formalized using modal epistemic logic.

- Example

  > e.g. Inform
  >
  > Suppose agent Alice ($A$) informs agent Bob ($B$) that, `It is raining`.
  >
  > This required **pre-conditions**. i.e., Before a valid utterance by $A$:
  > - $A$ must believe `It is raining`,
  > - $A$ must not already believe that $B$ has a belief regarding whether or not it is raining, and
  > - $A$ must desire that $B$ also comes to believe `It is raining`.
  >
  > Post-conditions: Upon receipt by $B$ of such an utterance by $A$
  >
  > - $B$ must believe that $A$ believes `It is raining`, and
  > - $B$ must believe that $A$ desires that $B$ believes `It is raining`.
  >
  > Following the utterance by $A, B$ may or may not adopt the belief `It is raining`.
  
- The FIPA semantics for inform

  - The single most common computer interaction is a request for a password. 

    - System $S$ asks agent $A$ to enter a password to login into system $S$. 

    >  e.g. 
    >
    > A use the inform utterance to give the password: 
    >
    > Inform ($A$, $S$, `password=pword263`)

  - Three pre-conditions

    - A must believe `password=pword263`. 

      > YES.

    - A must not already believe that S has a belief regarding whether or not `password=pword263`. 

      > But S already knows the password, and A knows that S knows the password.

    - A must desire that S also comes to believe `password=pword263`.

      > But what does A care about the future beliefs of S?

  - So an agent compliant with the semantics of FIPA ACL could NOT validly use the inform utterance to provide a password.


##### 8.2.3. Operational Semantics

- Definition

  - An operational semantics treats the utterances in an agent interaction as programming commands working on some large, virtual machine. 

    > The commands acts to change the state of this virtual machine.

  - We can therefore view utterances as functions which cause state transitions.

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
  	P((Prior state of machine))
  	S((Subsequent state of machine))
  	
  	P --Utterance--> S
  ```

##### 8.2.4. Denotational Semantics

- Definition

  - Each formula is mapped to some object in a mathematical space. 
  - Having a denotational mapping means we can reason about the language by reasoning about the mathematical objects.

- Example

  > e.g.
  >
  > Possible Worlds Semantics
  >
  > Game Semantics

- Possible Worlds Semantics

  - The standard semantics for *modal logic languages* is the Possible Worlds semantics. 
  - This is a collection of states of the world, <u>at each of which some propositions are true and some not</u>.
  - Some worlds are connected by accessibility relationships, indicating, e.g., that it is possible to move from one world-state to another.

##### 8.2.5. Game Theoretic Semantics

- Definition
  - Each well-formed statement in the language corresponds to a game G, usually between two fictional players, Protagonist P vs. Antagonist A.
  - Usually, we say that the goals of the players are:
    - P aims to win the game G, and
    - A aims is to prevent P from winning the game G.
  - The statement is true (or valid) if and only if P always has a winning strategy for the game.

### 8.3. Dialog Game Protocols

##### 8.3.1. Semantics and Protocols

- Protocols

  - ACLs and protocols usually defined with an axiomatic semantics for the utterances.

  - Some protocols have been given an operational semantics.

  - In a handful of cases, a denotational semantics has been given for utterances in a protocol.

    > e.g. utterances conceived as actions on a tuple space.

- Motivation

  - Problem: FIPA ACL is lack of structure, state-space explosion. 

  - Solutions:

    - Conversation Policies (CPs):

      - Sequences of utterance-patterns for a small number of utterances

      > e.g.
      >
      > - a question must be followed by a response
      > - a request for proposals must only be followed by a proposal or proposals.

    - Formal Dialog Games (DGs).

##### 8.3.2. Dialog Game Protocols

- Introduction

  - Games between two or more participants where each *moves* by making utterances, subject to some rules.

  - Origins in Philosophy

    > Aristotle and medieval philosophers
    >
    > Revived for the study of the logical fallacies in 1960s
    >
    > Applied to quantum physics (Mittelstaedt 1979).

  - Within computer science, applied to protocols for automated agent dialogues.

- Definition

  - A DG Protocol is defined in terms of the follows

    - A language of *statements* (the topics of the dialog)

    - A set of *utterance types* instantiated with the statements

      > e.g. `assert(p)`, `accept(p)`, `contest(p)`. 

    - *Combination rule*s, defining the circumstances in which each instantiated utterance may be uttered. 

    - *Termination Rules*, defining the circumstances in which dialogs terminate.

    - *Rules* for creating and combining commitments

      - Commitment Stores indicate publicly-accessible sets of statements, holding the commitments incurred by participants.

  - Relationship between types of *interaction protocols*

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	G[Generic ACLs]
    	DGP[Dialog Game Protocol]
    	A[Auction Mechansim]
    	
    	DGP --Increasing expressiveness--> G
    	DGP --Increasing constraints on utterances--> A
    ```

  - Typology of Dialogues

    - Dialogue: A group of interactions of agents. 
    - Classification on the basis of what each participant knows at outset, and what they each aim to achieve in the dialog. Purposed by Walton and Krabbe. 
      - Information-seeking dialogues
      - Inquiry dialogues
      - Persuasion dialogues
      - Negotiation dialogues
      - Deliberation dialogues
      - Eristic dialogues

- HTTP

  - What types of dialogs does Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol enable?

  - `GET`

    - One agent (the client) requests another agent (the server) to transfer from server to client a copy of the object specified by URL.

    - Server responds by doing so, or by sending a message explaining why server cannot do so.

      > e.g.
      >
      > - *404 Error:* File Not Found
      > - *503 Error*: Service Unavailable

  - `PUT`, `POST`

    - One agent (the client) transfers some data to another agent (the server).

  - Thus, HTTP combines dialogs for: 

    - Action-requests
    - Information-provision

##### 8.3.3. Formal Dialogue-Game Protocols

- Definition

  - Agent DG protocols have been designed for <u>all the Walton and Krabbe types</u>, as well as:
    - Information-provision dialogs
    - Argumentation dialogs
    - Command dialogs
    - Discovery dialogs
    - Design dialogs
  - These protocols are **more constrained** than are generic Agent Communications Languages (ACLs).
    - Rules govern combinations of locutions: agents usually cannot just say anything at any time.
    - Usually, the protocol is designed with a specific purpose in mind, and design may be informed by an explicit theory of argument.
  - Purpose - To check the following matters:
    - Termination of dialog, 
    - Equilibrium states, 
    - Expected length of dialog, 
    - Deadlocks,
    - Fairness,
    - Enter cycle or loop

- Example

  > e.g. 
  >
  > A simple DG protocol for info-seeking: Information-Seeking dialog
  >
  > For $p$ a proposition, and $S$ a set of propositions:
  >
  > - Valid utterances:
  >   - `question(p)`
  >   - `assert(p)`, `assert(S)`
  >   - `accept(p)`, `accept(S)`
  >   - `challenge(p)`
  > - Plus:
  >   - Special argument $U$ for `assert(.)` to indicate that <u>speaker is unable to give a response</u>.

  > e.g. 
  >
  > Just two agents, $A$ and $B$. Valid combination rules are given by:
  >
  > 1. $A$: `question(p)`
  > 2. $B$: Responds with one of 
  >    - `assert(p)`
  >    - `assert(~p)`
  >    - `assert(U)`
  > 3. $A$: Responds with one of (respectively)
  >    - `accept(p)` v `challenge(p)`
  >    - `accept(~p)` v `challenge(~p)`
  >    - `DIALOGUE ENDS`
  > 4. If `accept(.)`, then `DIALOGUE ENDS`.
  > 5. $B$: Replies to challenge with:
  >    - `assert(S)` ($S$ an argument for `p` or `~p`)
  > 6. Goto *3.*

  > e.g. Application of BGP. 
  >
  > - The **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** is an Internet Protocol at Layer 3 (the Network Layer)
  > - The **Fatio Argumentation Protocol** is an extension to FIPA ACL to allow intelligent agents to argue with one another.
  > - Fatio has been used to support automated identification and resolution of conflicts between hosts using the BGP.

- Research Challenge

  - Dialogs over action
  - Semantics of protocols
  - Properties of protocols
  - Better understanding of the relationships between syntax rules and protocol properties
  - How best to organize libraries of protocols (for efficient storage and search)
  - Automated negotiation over protocols.
