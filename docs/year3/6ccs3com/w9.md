### 9.1. Calculation of Communication Systems (CCS)

##### 9.1.1. Properties of Concurrent Computation

- Properties

  - **Non-termination**: the program(s) may not terminate, and additionally the output of a program may not be the focus of the computation.
  - **Parallelism**: steps of computation can occur simultaneously.
  - **Interference**: the meaning of a program may depend on the behaviour of other programs that are being executed.
  - **Non-determinism**: the same computations do not always produce the same results.

- Equivalence

  - Define the equivalence of two programs

    - Two *sequential* programs are equivalent if for all inputs they give the same outputs.
      $$
      \begin{matrix}
      f = g & \text{iff } \forall x, f(x) = g(x)
      \end{matrix}
      $$
      
    - But in concurrent programs the output is rarely the focus, and is more commonly non-deterministic/non-terminating...
  
  - For concurrent programs, we could NOT
  
    - Compare their associated language. Since accepted words are not the focus in concurrent systems.
    - Compare their behaviour. Since we need a calculus to describe the behaviour of concurrent systems.
  
  - Instead, we could use the **calculus of communicating systems (CCS)**.
  
    - Includes
      - Syntax
      - Semantics
    - Labelled transition systems.
    - Used to define the equivalence of concurrent processes.

##### 9.1.2. Introduction to CCS 

- Definition

  - Introduced by Milner in 1980s to have an abstract model that focuses on modelling concurrent systems.

  - Milner's general model:

    - A **concurrent system** is a collection of processes.
    - A **process** is an independent agent that may perform internal activities in isolation, or may interact with the environment to perform shared activities.

    > e.g.
    >
    > A vending machine can be represented as follows:
    >
    > `coke.coin.coke_can.0 + chocolate.coin.chocolate_bar.0`
    >
    > With the following elements of syntax:
    >
    > 1. **Actions**: `coke`, `coke_can`
    > 2. **Sequential composition** (denotes as `.`): `a.b`, indicates first do `a`, then do `b`
    > 3. **Non-deterministic choice** (denotes as `+`): `c+d`, indicates do `c` or `d`
    > 4. **Terminal process**: `0`
    >
    > Processes perform actions ($\to^\text{action}$), and become a new process:
    >
    > `coke.coin.coke_can.0 + chocolate.coin.chocolate_bar.0` 
    >
    > $\to^\text{coke}$ `coin.coke can.0`
    >
    > $\to^\text{coin}$ `coke_can.0`
    >
    > $\to^\text{coke\_can}$ `0`


##### 9.1.3. Syntax

- Terminal Process

  - The simplest possible process is a terminal process, which is a terminated, inactive, or deadlocked process.
  - Represented by `0`.

- Actions

  - A set of **labels** for actions:
    $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{N} \cup \bar{\mathcal{N}} \cup \{\tau\} = \{a, b, c, ...\} \cup \{a, b, c, ...\} \cup \{\tau\}$

  - Input actions: $i \in \mathcal{N}$

  - Output actions: $o \in \bar{\mathcal{N}}$

  - Internal actions: $τ$ represents an internal action.

- Action prefixing

  - The simplest behaviour is **sequential action**.

  - If $P$ is a process, we write $\alpha.P$ to denote the **prefixing** of $P$ with action $α$.

  - $α.P$ models a system that is ready to perform the action $α$ and then it will behave as $P$.

    > i.e., $\alpha . P \to^\alpha P$

- Non-deterministic Choice

  - Alternative behaviours can be used to model **non-deterministic choice**.

  - If $P$ and $Q$ are processes, we write $P + Q$ to denote the non-deterministic choice between $P$ and $Q$.

  - $P + Q$ models a process that can behave as $P$ (discarding $Q$), or behave as $Q$ (discarding $P$).

    `coke.coin.coke_can.0 + chocolate.coin.chocolate_bar.0`

    $\to^\text{coke}$ `coin.coke_can.0`

  - Note: $P + Q = Q + P$

- Constants and Recursion

  - We can define **process constants**, that can be defined recursively.
  - $P ::= a.b.c.0$, $P$ is defined as a constant for the process $a.b.c.0$.
  - Allows processes to continue *ad infinitum*.
  - 

- Parallel Composition

  - Concurrent behaviour can be modelled with parallel composition.

  - If $P$ and $Q$ are processes, we write $P|Q$ to denote the parallel composition of $P$ and $Q$.

  - $P|Q$ models a process that behaves like $P, Q$ in parallel:

    - Each may proceed independently
    - If $P$ is ready to perform an action $a$ and $Q$ is ready to perform the complementary action $a$, they may interact ($\to^\tau$, a step internal to the process).

    > Note. $P|Q = Q|P$

  > e.g.
  >
  > Assume a vending machine:
  >
  > `HDM ::= tea.coin.cup_of_tea.HDM + coffee.coin.coin.mug_of_coffee.HDM`
  >
  > And the concurrent system, a computer scientist CS:
  >
  > `CS ::= tea.coin.cup_of_tea.teach.CS + coffee.coin.coin.mug_of_coffee.research.CS`
  >
  > We can now compose a process for the average day:
  >
  > `HDM | CS`
  >
  > How might the process behave?
  >
  > >`(tea.coin.cup_of_tea.HDM + coffee.coin.coin.mug_of_coffee.HDM) |`
  > >
  > >`(tea.coin.cup_of_tea.teach.CS + coffee.coin.coin.mug_of_coffee.research.CS)`
  > >
  > >$\to^\tau$ `(coin.cup_of_tea.HDM) | (coin.cup_of_tea.teach.CS)`
  > >
  > >$\to^\tau$ `(cup_of_tea.HDM) | cup_of_tea.teach.CS`
  > >
  > >$\to^\tau$ `HDM | teach.CS`
  > >
  > >$\to^\text{teach}$ `HDM |CS`

- Restriction

  - We can control **unwanted interactions** between processes by **restricting** action/co-action pairs.
  - If $P$ is a process and a is an action we write $νa.P$ for the restriction of $a$ in $P$.
    - $P$ can no longer take action $a$ or $\bar{a}$ with external processes.
    - However, $P$ can take actions $a$ and $\hat{a}$ together as an internal action ($τ$-action).

- Summary

  - We can define a grammar for CCS processes as follows.
    $$
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    P \to & K &| \text{Process Constants} \\
    ~ & \alpha.P &| \text{Action prefixing } (\alpha \in \mathcal{A}) \\
    ~ & \sum_{i \in I} &| \text{Summation } (P_0 + P_1 + ... + P_I)\\
    ~ & P_1 | P_2 &| \text{Parallel composition}\\
    ~ & ν \alpha.P &| \text{Restriction } (\alpha \in \mathcal{A})\\
    ~ & 0 &| \text{Terminal process}\\
    \end{array}
    $$

### 9.2. Labelled Transition Systems

##### 9.2.1. Introduction to Labelled Transition Systems

- Definition

  - A **labelled transition system (LTS)** is a triple $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A}, \{\to^\alpha | \alpha \in \mathcal{A} \})$

    - $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of processes (the nodes).
    - $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of actions (the labels).
    - For every $α ∈ \mathcal{A}, \to^\alpha ⊆ P \times P$ is a binary relation on processes called the transition relation (the edges).

  - The LTS can correspond to a directed graph.

    > e.g.
    >
    > $\{\{P,Q,R\},\{a,b,\tau \},\{P \to^a Q,P \to^b R,Q \to^a R\}\}$
    >
    > corresponds to the directed graph
    >
    > ```mermaid
    > graph LR
    > 	P --a--> Q
    > 	P --b--> R
    > 	Q --a--> R
    > 	
    > ```

##### 9.2.2. LTS for CCS

- Motivation: Produce the LTS of a CCS process.

- Informal semantics

  - **Action prefixing**: $\alpha.P$

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	a[α.P]
    	a --α--> P
    ```

  - **Non-deterministic choice**: $α.P + β.Q$

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	a[α.P + β.Q] --α--> P
    	a --β--> Q
    ```

  - **Recursion**: $\alpha.X$

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
    	X --α--> X
    ```

  - **Parallel composition**: $\alpha.P |\beta.Q$

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	a[α.P\β.Q] --α--> b[P\β.Q]
    	a --β--> c[α.P\Q]
    	b --β--> d[P\Q]
    	c --α--> d
    	
    ```

  - **Parallel composition (interaction)**: $\alpha.P |\bar{\alpha}.Q$

    - A special form of parallel composition, where $β = α$. The τ transition is an interaction between $P$ and $Q$ that is internal to $P|Q$.

      ```mermaid
      graph LR
      	a[α.P\ ~α.Q] --α--> b[P\ ~α.Q]
      	a --~α--> c[α.P\Q]
      	b --~α--> d[P\Q]
      	a --τ--> d
      	c --α--> d
      
      ```

  - **Terminal process**: 0

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	0
    ```

  - **Restriction**: $να.(α.P)$

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	a[να.<α.P>]
    ```

  - **Restriction and interaction**: $να.(α.A|\bar{α}.B)$

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	a[να.<α.P>] --τ--> b[να.< A\B >]
    ```

##### 9.2.3. Formal Semantics for CCS

- Definition

  - The LTS $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A},\{\to^\alpha | \alpha \in \mathcal{A}\})$ of a CCS process is as follows:
    - $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of all CCS process expressions
    - $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all CCS actions (including $τ$)
    - The transition relation is given by the rules in the table below.

  | Rule | Premise                          | Transition              | Conditions                        |
  | ---- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
  | ACT  |                                  | $α.P \to^\alpha P$      |                                   |
  | SUM  | $P \to^\alpha P'$                | $M + P \to^\alpha P'$   |                                   |
  | CON  | $P \to^\alpha P'$                | $K \to^\alpha P'$       | $K ::= P$                         |
  | COM1 | $P \to^\alpha P'$                | $P|Q \to^\alpha P'|Q$   |                                   |
  | COM2 | $Q \to^\alpha Q'$                | $P|Q \to^\alpha P|Q'$   |                                   |
  | COM3 | $P \to^a P', Q \to^{\bar{a}} Q'$ | $P|Q \to^\tau P'|Q'$    |                                   |
  | RES  | $P \to^\alpha P'$                | $νβ.P \to^\alpha νβ.P'$ | $\alpha, \bar{\alpha} \neq \beta$ |

##### 9.2.4. Equivalence

- Definition

  - Back to our original question: when are two **concurrent** programs equivalent? We now have a way to describe concurrent programs (CCS) and capture their behaviour (LTS).
  - **Bisimilarity**: Two concurrent processes are equivalent iff <u>an external observer cannot tell their behaviour apart</u>.

- Strong bisimilarity

  - Let $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A},\{→α |α \in \mathcal{A}\})$ be an LTS.

    - A binary relation $S ⊆ \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{P}$ is a **strong bisimulation** iff whenever $(P,Q) \in S$ then for each $α \in (\mathcal{A}−\{τ\})$:
      1. if $P \to^\alpha P'$ then $Q \to^\alpha Q'$ for some $Q'$ such that $(P', Q') \in S$,
      2. if $Q \to^\alpha Q'$ then $P \to^\alpha P'$ for some $P'$ such that $(P', Q') \in S$.

  - We do NOT consider $τ$​-actions, since an observer can’t see internal actions, so they are not part of the

    visible behaviour.

  - Two processes are **strongly bisimilar** iff there exists a strong bisiumlation of their LTSs.
