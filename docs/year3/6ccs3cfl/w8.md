### 8.1. Functional Language

##### 8.1.1. Grammar of Functional Langauge

- Motivation

  - The language we looked at in the previous lecture was rather primitive and the compiler rather crude.

- Definition

  - The *Fun-language* is a small functional programming language. A small collection of programs we want to be able to write and compile is as follows:

    ```scala
    def fib(n) = if n == 0 then 0 
    						 else if n == 1 then 1
    						 else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    def fact(n) = if n == 0 then 1 
    							else n * fact(n - 1);
    def ack(m, n) = if m == 0 then n + 1
    								else if n == 0 then ack(m - 1, 1)
    								else ack(m - 1, ack(m, n - 1));
    def gcd(a, b) = if b == 0 then a 
    								else gcd(b, a % b);
    ```

    > Note. We will still focus on programs involving **integers** only. 

  - The grammar of the Fun-language is defined as follows, 
    $$
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    Exp &::= &Id | Num \\
     &| & Exp + Exp | ... | (Exp) \\
     &| & \texttt{if } Exp \texttt{ then } Exp \texttt{ else } Exp \\
     &| & \texttt{write } Exp \\
     &| & Exp; Exp \\
     &| & \text{FunName}(Exp, ..., Exp) \\
    BExp &::= & ... \\
    Decl &::= &Def; Decl | Exp \\
    Def &::= &\texttt{def } \text{FunName}(x_1, ..., x_n) = Exp
    \end{array}
    $$
    We can call a function by applying the arguments to a function name (as shown in the last clause of $Exp$). The arguments in such a function call can be again expressions, including other function calls. 

  - A Fun-program is then a sequence of function definitions separated by semicolons `;`.

  - Afinal `main` call of a function that starts the computation in the program.

    >
    > ```scala
    > def fact(n) = if n == 0 then 1
    > 							else n * fact(n - 1);
    > write(fact(5))
    > ```
    >
    > This is a valid Fun-program. 

- Examples

  > - Sequence
  >   For an expression of the form `exp1 ; exp2` we need to generate code where after the first code chunk a pop-instruction is needed.

  >   - We need to duplicate the top element of the stack, since every expression needs to return an integer as a result, but consumes the top element of the stack and violates this convention.

  >     .limit stack 2
  >     getstatic java/lang/System/out Ljava/io/PrintStream; iload 0
  >     invokevirtual java/io/PrintStream/println(I)V
  >     return
  >     .end method
  >     ```
  >

  >     .limit locals ??
  >     .limit stack ??
  >     ...
  >     ireturn
  >     .method end
  >
  >   - The number of `Is` corresponds to the number of arguments the function has, say `x1` to `xn`. 
  >   
  >   - The final I is needed in order to indicate that the function returns an integer. Therefore we also have to use `ireturn` instead of `return`.
  >
  


##### 8.1.2. Stack Estimate

- Motivation

  - Calculating how much stack a program needs is equivalent to the Halting problem, and thus undecidable in general.
  - Fortunately, we are only asked how much stack a *single* call of the function requires. 
  - This can be relatively easily compiled by recursively analysing which instructions we generate and how much stack they might require.

- Definition

  - This function overestimates the stack size. 
  - Since we cannot predict which branch will be run, we have to allocate the maximum of stack each branch might take. 

  $$
  \begin{array}{lcl}
  estimate(n) &\overset{def}= &1\\
  estimate(x) &\overset{def}= &1\\
  estimate(a_1 \text{ aop } a_2) &\overset{def}= &estimate(a_1) + estimate(a_2) \\
  estimate(\texttt{if }b \texttt{ then }e_1 \texttt{ else} e_2)  &\overset{def}= &estimate(b) + \max((estimate(e_1), estimate(e_2)) \\
  estimate(f(e_1,...,e_n)) &\overset{def}= &\sum_{i=1...n} estimate(e_i) \\
  estimate(a_1 \text{ bop } a_2) &\overset{def}= &estimate(a_1) + estimate(a_2)
  \end{array}
  $$

##### 8.1.3. Examples

- With the given definitions we can start with generating code.

> e.g.
>
> Considering the following code: 
>
> ```
> def suc(x) = x + 1;
> def add(x, y) = if x == 0 then y
> 	else suc(add(x - 1, y));
> ```

> e.g.
>
> Successor Function
>
> - The successor function is a simple loading of the argument $x$ (index 0) onto the stack, as well as the number 1. 
> - Then we add both elements leaving the result of the addition on top of the stack.
>
> ```assembly
> .method public static suc(I)I
> .limit locals 1
> .limit stack 2
> iload 0
> ldc 1
> iadd
> ireturn
> .end method
> ```

> e.g.
>
> Addition Function
>
> - In the last line we have to call the function recursively and wrap around a call to the successor function.
> - The locals limit is 2 because add takes two arguments. The stack limit is a simple calculation using the estimate function. 
> - Process
>   - We first have to evaluate the argument of the suc-function. This means loading $x$ and 1 onto the stack and subtracting them. 
>   - Then loading $y$ onto the stack. When this call returns we have the result of the addition on the top of the stack and just need to call `suc`. 
>   - Finally, return the result on top of the stack as the result of the add-function.
>
>
> ```assembly
> .method public static add(II)I
> .limit locals 2
> .limit stack 5
> 	iload 0
> 	ldc 0
> 	if_icmpne If_else
> 	iload 1
> 	goto If_end

### 8.2. Tail-Call Optimization

##### 8.2.1. Motivation

- Motivation

  - For some functions in functional languages, tail-recursion is highly cost. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > Factorial Function
    >
    > Consider the following code: 
    >
    > ```
    > def facT(n, acc) =
    > 	if n == 0 then acc
    > 	else facT(n ‐ 1, n * acc);
    > ```
    >
    > ```assembly
    > .method public static facT(II)I 
    > .limit locals 2
    > .limit stack 6
    > /* facT_Start */
    > 	iload 0
    > 	ldc 0
    > 	if_icmpne If_else_2 iload 1
    > 	goto If_end_3
    > If_else_2:
    > 	iload 0
    > 	ldc 1
    > 	isub
    > 	iload 0
    > 	iload 1
    > 	imul
    > 	/* istore 1 */
    > 	/* istore 0 */
    > 	/* goto facT_Start */
    > 	invokestatic fact/fact/facT(II)I
    > If_end_3:
    > 	ireturn
    > .end method
    > ```
    >
    > - We need to take 2 arguments onto the stack. This may ultimately lead to a stack overflow. 

  - Tail-call optimization could helps us avoiding such circumstances. 

  - This is well known and widely implemented in compilers for functional programming languages.

##### 8.2.2. Process

- Process

  - The idea of *tail-call optimization* is to <u>eliminate the expensive recursive functions call</u> and <u>replace it by a simple jump back to the beginning of the function</u>.

  - we cannot use the stack, but have to load the arguments into the corresponding local variables.

    > This gives the updated code above. 
    >
    > - In Line 4 we Introduce a label for indicating where the start of the function is.
    > - Lines 17 and 18 store the values from the stack into local variables. 

- Applicatable Senarios

  - Such optimization can NOT always be applied. 

  - The recursive call needs to be in tail-call position, that is the last operation needs to be the recursive call. 

    > i.e., Very roughly speaking the tail-position of a function is in the two highlighted places
    >
    > ```
    > if Bexp then *Exp* else *Exp* 
    > Exp ; *Exp*
    > ```

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```
    > def fact(n) = if n == 0 then 1
    > 	else n * fact(n - 1)
    > ```
    >
    > In this version of the factorial function the recursive call is NOT the last operation. Because of this, the plumbing of local variables would not work and in effect the optimization is NOT applicable. 

##### 8.2.3. Dijkstra on Testing

- What is good about compilers: the either seem to work, or go horribly wrong (most of the time).
