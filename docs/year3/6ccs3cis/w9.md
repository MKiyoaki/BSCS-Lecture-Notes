### 9.1. Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs

##### 9.1.1. Interactie Proof

- Proof

  > a fact or piece of information that shows that something exists or is true. 

- Interactie Proof

  - Definition

    - We say that $x$ is a *statement* and $w$ is a *witness*. $R(x,w) = 1$ means that $w$ is a valid witness for $x$ w.r.t. the relation $R$.
    - Prover and verifier communicate with each other, and at the end the verifier outputs 1 (accept), or 0 (reject).

  - Properties

    - **Correctness**: For an honest prover, the verifier always accepts.
    - **Soundness**: Any cheating prover, who does not know the witness w, cannot convince the verifier to accept with probability meaningfully more than zero.
