### 4.1. SPN

##### 4.1.1. Motivation

- Historical ciphers

  - *ad hoc* without clear security definitions to try and satsify. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > A single message ciphertext pair is often devastating, meaningful information about messages easily inferrable from ciphertexts, an arms race of adding more complexity and deviousness.

- We want to introduce a new cryptography scheme to enhance the security. 

  - Recall the mono-alphabetic cipher.
    $\text{SKE=\{KGen, Enc, Dec\}}$ with $\alpha = \{a, ..., z\}$, $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{C} = \alpha^*$ and $\mathcal{K} = \text{Perm}(\alpha)$.
    - $\text{KGen}$ samples uniformly from $\text{Perm}(\alpha)$,
    - $\text{Enc}(sk, m)$ applies the permutation to each letter of $m$,
    - $\text{Dec}(sk, c)$ applies the inverse permutation to each letter of $c$. 
  - A good property is that $sk(a)$ and $sk(b)$ are almost independent.

##### 4.1.2. Permutations

- Definition

  - Given a finite set $X = \{x_1, ..., x_t\}$, a **permutation** is a bijection $\pi: X \to X$. 

  - $\text{Perm}(X)$ is the set of permutations and $|\text{Perm}(X)|=t!=t \times (t-1) \times ... \times 2 \times 1$. 

    > e.g.
    >
    > Let $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$. One permutation is $\pi(1)=1, \pi(2)=3, \pi(3)=2$. 

  - Almost independent means

    - knowing $\pi(x_i)=x_j$ tells us nothing about $\pi(x_k), k \neq i$, 
    - except that it does not equal $x_j$.

- Permutations of binary strings

  - Imagine $X = \{0, 1\}^l$, the set of binary strings of length $l$. Then
    - $|\text{Perm}(X)|=(2^l)!$
    - An enormous number. 

##### 4.1.3. Block Cipher

- Definition

  - **Block ciphers** are a building block for SKE. A block cipher is a function
    $$
    F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l
    $$
    where $n$ is the key length and $l$ the block length, such that for each key $sk$
    $$
    F_{sk} = F(sk, \cdot): \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l
    $$
    is a permutation.

- Improvement

  - For a uniform $sk$ we want $F_{sk}$ to behave like a uniform permutation $(*)$.

    - Let $sk$ define a permutation is not possible. Since we would need $ n \approx l \cdot 2^l$ bits. 
    - We need to achieve $(*)$ with a reasonable key length $n$ by **Substitution permutation networks (SPN)**. 
    
      > i.e., SPN is a technology that can be used to construct block ciphers. 
    - Shannon's big idea: many smaller permutations repeated many times. 
      - <u>Divide the block</u> length $l$ into smaller blocks of length $l^′$. Apply a permutation of binary strings (substitution).
      - Apply a permutation on indices to the entire block of length $l$ (permutation). 
      - Repeat the above until enough times, called the number $r$ of *rounds*.
    - We have two permutations
    
    $$
    S: \{0, 1\}^{l^{'}} \to \{0, 1\}^{l^{'}} \\
    P: \{1, ..., l\} \to \{1, ..., l\}
    $$

  > e.g.
  >
  > Let $l=8, l^{'}=4, m = \text{0110 0111}$, and $S, P$ given as the following tables: 
  >
  > | 0000     | 0001     | ...     | 0110     | 0111     | ...     |
  > | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
  > | **0100** | **0011** | **...** | **0101** | **1110** | **...** |
  >
  > | 1     | 2     |
  > | ----- | ----- |
  > | **2** | **6** |
  > | **3** | **5** |
  > | **4** | **1** |
  > | **5** | **3** |
  > | **6** | **4** |
  > | **7** | **7** |
  > | **8** | **8** |
  >
  > Parse $m$ as length $l^{'}$ blocks, apply $S$ to both, $S(m) = S(m_1)||S(m_2) = \text{0101 1110}$. (Substitution according to $S$). 
  >
  > Permute the indices according to $P$, so $P(S(m)) = \text{1011 0110}$. 

##### 4.1.4. Substitution-Permutation Network

- Definition

  - The core idea of SPN is to introduce **substitution** and **permutation** to process with input with the unit of blocks.

  - We could encode $S, P$ in $sk$, i.e., 
  
    - We XOR (parts of) $sk$ with the message and let $S$ and $P$ be public.
    - Let $n=16, l=8,l^{′} =4,m= 0110 \parallel 0111 $ and $sk=sk_1 \parallel sk_2$. Let $m^{(0)} =m$ then *two rounds* of this SPN could be
      $$
      m^{(1)} = P(S(sk_1 ⊕ m^{(0)})) \\
      m^{(2)} = P(S(sk_2 ⊕ m^{(0)})) \\
      $$
  
    - We call $sk_1, sk_2$ by **round keys**. 

      > Actually, $P, S$ are unnecessary in the final (here second) round.

  - More rounds
  
    - In general
      - The input to round $i$ is $m^{(i-1)}$.
      - We XOR the round key $sk_i ⊕ m^{(i-1)}$
      - Apply $S$ to permute indices $m^{(i)} = P(S(sk_i ⊕ m^{(i-1)}))$.
    - We <u>do NOT apply $P$ or $S$ in the final round</u>, instead just XOR the round key $sk_r$.
    - The final output is $F_{sk}(m) = m_{(r)}$.

- Invert $sk$

  - Process

    - Take XOR
    - Apply $P^{-1}$
    - Apply $S^{-1}$
  
  - Example
  
    > e.g.
    >
    > $F :\{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l$ with $n = 2l$ and some public $S, P$. 
    >
    > $F_{sk}(m)$ does
    >
    > - Let $m^{(0)} = m$ and parse $sk$ as $sk_1 \parallel sk_2$ each of length $l$,
    > - Let $m^{(1)} = P(S(sk_1 ⊕ m^{(0)}))$, 
    > - Let $m^{(2)} = sk_2 ⊕ m^{(1)}$ and return it. 
    >
    > If you know $sk$ and $S, P$ are public, how to invert $F_{sk}$, i.e., recover $m$ from $m^{(2)}$
    >
    > 1. $m^{(1)} = m^{(2)} ⊕ sk_2$, 
    > 2. $S^{-1}(P^{-1}(m^{(1)})) = sk_1 ⊕ m^{(0)}$, 
    > 3. Use $sk_1$ to return $m^{(0)} = m$.

### 4.2.  Feistel Networks

##### 4.2.1. Intuition

- Idea
  - $S$ *mixes up* small block (with the length $l^{'}$), $P$ moves this *mixed upness* throughout the entire block (length $l$). 
  - Shannon called this *confuse and diffuse*. 
- Questions
  - How to design $S, P$ for effectively confuse and diffuse, 
  - How many rounds $r$ are required,
  - How to derive round keys $sk_1, ..., sk_r$ from $sk$. 
- Solution
  - Another approach Feistel Network. 
  

##### 4.2.2. Feistel Networks

- Definition

  - <u>Another approach</u>, due to Horst Feistel at IBM, of achieving $(*)$ for a block cipher
    $$
    F: \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^l \to \{0, 1\}^l
    $$
    It operates over some number $r$ of rounds, using (parts of) $sk$ in each round.

- Process

  - Let $sk_1, ..., sk_r$ of length $n^{'}$ be round keys derived from $sk$. 
    Let $f_1, ..., f_r$ be *round functions*, defined as $f_i: \{0, 1\}^{n^{'}} \times \{0, 1\}^{l/2} \to \{0, 1\}^{l/2}$
    
    - In round 1

      - $f_1: \{0, 1\}^{n^{'}} \times \{0, 1\}^{l/2} \to \{0, 1\}^{l/2}$
      - $m^{(0)} = m = L_0 \parallel R_0$. 
    
      > i.e., The message will be split into two parts $L, R$. 
    - The output of round 1
    
      - $L_1 = R_0$
      - $R_1 = L_0 ⊕ f_1 (sk_1, R_0)$
      - $m^{(1)} = L_1 \parallel R_1$
    
      > i.e., For each round $i$:
      >
      > Pass the previous round right part to left: $L_i = R_{i-1}$
      >
      > Compute the new right part by XOR and round function: $R_i = L_{i-1} ⊕ f_i(R_{i-1}, k_i)$
    
  - More Rounds
  
    - In general
      - The input to round $i$ is $m^{(i-1)}$, parsed as $L_{i-1}||R_{i-1}$, 
      - Let $L_i = R_{i-1}$, 
      - Let $R_i =  L_{i-1} ⊕ f_i(sk_i, R_{i-1})$,
      - Let $m^{(i)} = L_i || R_i$, 
      - The final output is $F_{sk}(m) = m^{(r)}$.
  - Invert $sk$
  
    - Process
    
      - Revert the right part $R_{i-1}=L_i$
      - Revert the left part $L_{i-1} = R_i ⊕ f(L_i, k_i)$
      - Repeat the above process round by round, from $L_r \parallel R_r$ until $L_0 \parallel R_0$. 
    
    - Example
    
      > e.g.
      >
      > ...


##### 4.2.3. Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- Definition

  - DES is now depreciated block cipher based on Feistel networks, where $n = 56, l = 64, r = 16$. 

    > It was refined from an earlier, similar cipher LUCIFER produced by IBM. 

  - The key size of 56 bits can now be brute force searched, so a variant called *Triple DES* is sometimes still used in legacy applications.
  
  > We will focus on AES instead.
