### 27. Introduction to Unix 

##### 27.1. Introduction to Unix

- Unix
  - The first version(s) of the Unix OS were created at AT&T Bell Labs during 1969–71. 
  - Much of the technical language of operating systems derives from Unix: kernel, shell, inode, pipe, root, ...
  - All widely used operating systems are largely Unix*-like*. Only Windows cannot be called a Unix: it is based more on VMS, but was influenced by Unix via Ultrix and CP/M, and by some of *Unix*’s earlier influences *(e.g. CTSS, Multics, TOPS-10)*.
- Why popular?
  - Deliberate simplicity
  - Written mostly in high-level language, C 
  - Academic licensing (in the early days)
- 

##### 27.2. Big ideas of Unix

- Forking Processes

  - To create a new process in Unix, you can *fork* (duplicate) the current process. If you don't want this (normal!) you then *exec* (replace with) a different program.

  - Evaluation

    - Pros ✅

      - Set-up of new process done *in code* by the parent process.

        >
        > To hook up pipes or other IPC channels. 

      - Easy to arrange sharing between parent and child (of memory, of file desriptors, of IPC channels, etc). 

      - Avoids the need for a 'mega-API' that can control all attributes of a new process created from scratch. 

      - Also good for concurrent servers, in pre-thread days. 

- Everything is a file

  > ![Unix File System - GeeksforGeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231031164439/Unix-File-System.png)

  - Instead of (as earlier designs) special categories for system commands, devices, files, ... (each with their own interfaces), which maximise use of the file abstraction. 

    - Devices appear as special files
    - Commands are just executable files
    - Even non-file means of inter-process communication *(e.g. pipes)* are accessed via file descriptors. 

  - Evaluation 

    - Pros ✅

      - Avoid special interfaces
      - Maximise compositionality

    - Cons ❌

      - Not everything is (conceptually) a file. 

        > e.g.
        >
        > `seek()`
        >
        > `ioctl()`
        >
        > Unix provides no explicit way for files to express how they *differ*, like operations, behaviour, data formats...

##### 27.3. Microkernels

- Definition
  - **Microkernels** 
    - Moving things out of the kernel. Including
      - device drivers
      - file and network abstractions
      - paging
    - Moving to server processes
      - Problem - IPC overhead
      - Much more crossing of protection boundaries
