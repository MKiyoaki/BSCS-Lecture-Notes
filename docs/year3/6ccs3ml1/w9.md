##### 9.1.1. Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)

- Definition
  - An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a way of doing **search**. It is inspired by evolutionary biology and concepts from genetics.
  - We have a <u>population</u> of individuals where each <u>individual</u> is a representation of a solution to a problem.
  - We build a representation and decide how to combine these representations by doing:
    - Selection, and
    - Reproduction
  - Establishing and evaluating a population can be viewed as a (massively) parallel search.
- Simulation of the Evolution Process.
  - A population of candidate solutions evolves towards better solutions by repeatedly selecting the fit individuals from the current population and modifying them to form the next generation population.

##### 9.1.2. Genetic Algorithms (GAs)

- Overview
  - Loosely based on the idea of simulated evolution: survival of the fittest (Darwin).
  - In general, we hypothesise a population of candidate solutions to a particular problem.
