### 1. Introduction to AI

##### 1.1. Approaches to AI

- Intelligent machines

  >| Systems that think like humans       | probabilitySystems that think rationally |
  >| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
  >| Cognitive models of how humans think | Laws from logic, probability             |
  >| Systems that act like humans         | Systems that act rationally              |

  - Definition

    - A system is intelligent if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from a human’s.

  - Tests

    >Turing test
    >
    >- Let a human ask questions to a system, If the human cannot tell whether the answers were given by a human or machine, it passes the test
    >
    >Total Turing test
    >
    >- A robot is intelligent if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from a human’s
    >- Includes physical behavior

- Agent

  - Definition

    - A unit that makes an intelligent decision when given the opportunity.
    - Uses knowledge it has at that point in time to make decision.
    - Decision limited by range of actions possible at that point in time.

  - Types

    - **Autonomous agent** - makes decisions <u>without human input</u>.

    - **Rational agent** - always takes the <u>best action at a given point</u>.

      > e.g. a robot, autonomous vehicle, an enemy monster in a game, etc.

##### 1.2. Ways of encoding knowledge

- **Model-Based**

  >i.e., explicit knowledge --> Symbolic/Classical AI

  - Features
    - Define an encoding of what the world looks like.
    - Define how we can change that world.
    - Search for good strategies on how to change the world the way we want to.
    - Pretends to <u>think like a human</u>.

- **Data-Driven**

  > i.e., tacit knowledge --> Machine Learning

  - Reads in coarse data from a specific problem.
  - Is told the problem it’s trying to solve.
  - Changes the model such that it gets the correct output.
  - Pretends to <u>learn like a human</u>.

##### 1.3. AI Evolution

- History of AI

  >1958 - Herbert A. Simon: "within 10 years a digital computer will be the world’s chess champion".
  >
  >1967 - Marvin Minsky: "within a generation, the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".
  >
  >1997 - IBM's Deep Blue beats Gary Kasparov
  >
  >2016 - DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats Lee Sedol
  >
  >2017 - DeepMind's AlphaZero becomes one of the strongest chess players of all time.
  >
  >2019 - DeepMind’s AlphaStar achieves grandmaster status in StarCraft II.
  >
  >However, true general intelligence still a long way off.

- AI in the Modern World

##### 1.4. Value alignment problem

>1. How to align the values of your system with those of humans who use and are impact by the system?
>2. How to exactly specify what a "good" *(song recommendation / conversation / game experience, etc. )* is?
>
>| Human                                | AI                             |
>| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
>| Self-directed Goals                  | Statistical reasoning          |
>| Common sense                         | Large-scale maths              |
>| Learn from few examples              | Huge state-space exploration   |
>| Adapt to similar but different tasks | Computational power (at scale) |
>| Emotional intelligence               |                                |

### 2. Search Algorithms

##### 2.1. Search Problems

- Goal - Process of computing a sequence of actions that form a path to a goal.

- Parameters

  - State space
  - Initial state & goal test
  - Actions
  - Transition model
  - Action costs

- Examples

  > e.g.
  >
  > Navigate from A to B, Self-service checkout, etc.

##### 2.2. Search Trees & Search Algorithms

- Search Tree
- Search Algorithms
  - Most search algorithms use a search tree to find a path from the initial state until a goal state.
  - Different algorithms use different strategies to find a path.

##### 2.3. BFS & DFS Algorithms

- Breadth-First Search BFS

  > BFS uses a **search tree** to find solution to search problem. Search the tree in same-depth slices, skip already reached states. 

  - Process

    >![BFS Example Solution - Breadth First Search Algorithm - Edureka](https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BFS-Example-Solution-Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm-Edureka-1.png)

    1. 

  - Pseudocode

    >```
    >Input: s as the source node
    > 
    >BFS (G, s)
    >let Q be queue.
    >Q.enqueue( s )
    > 
    >mark s as visited
    >while ( Q is not empty)
    >v = Q.dequeue( )
    > 
    >for all neighbors w of v in Graph G
    >if w is not visited
    >Q.enqueue( w )
    >mark w as visited
    >```

  - Properties

    - Completeness - ✅

      > Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one? 

    - Optimality - ✅

      > Does the algorithm find the optimal solution? 

    - Complexity

      > $b$​ stands for branching factor
      >
      > $d$ stands for the level of the goal

      - Time - $\sum_{i=1}^{d}b^i$
      - Space - $\sum_{i=1}^{d}b^i$

- Depth-First Search DFS

  > DFS uses a **search tree** to find solution to search problem. DFS expands deepest nodes first.

  - Process

  - Properties

    - Completeness - ✅

    - Optimality - ❌

      > Regardless of depth or cost.

    - Complexity

      >$b$ stands for branching factor
      >
      >$m$ for maximum depth of the tree

      - Time - $\sum_{i=1}^{d}b^m$
      - Space - $b \cdot m$


##### 2.4. Best-First Search & Uniform Cost Search

- Best-First Search

  > Keep a *priority queue* of nodes to explore, **ordered by a value $f$**. At each iteration we **pick the node with the next lowest $f$** value

  - Process
    1. Define a value function $f(n)$, keep a *priority queue* of nodes ordered by $f$
    2. At each iteration: expand the node at the front of the queue.
    3. Stop when a goal node is expanded.
  - Properties
    - Completeness
    - Optimality
    - Complexity
      - Time
      - Space

- Uniform Cost Search UCS

  > Expand best node first, where "best" means reached by lowest cost.
  >
  > Best-first search with $f(n)=\text{sum of costs of actions from start to }n$
  > Finds minimum-cost plans

  - Process
    1. Define $g(n) = \text{the cost of the path}$, from the initial state to $n$
    2. Run Best First Search with $f(n)$ = $g(n)$
    3. Guaranteed to find a shortest path to a goal node
  - Properties
    - Completeness - ✅
    - Optimality - ✅
    - Complexity
      - Time - $\text{cost < cost of goal}$
      - Space -  $\text{cost < cost of goal}$
