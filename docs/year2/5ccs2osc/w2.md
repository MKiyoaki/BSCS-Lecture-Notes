### 4. Multithreading

##### 4.1. Definition

- We can now create multithreaded programs - Programs in which there are multiple threads of execution occurring *at the same time*.
- Considering on CPUs
  - If there is a single core, then multithreading creates the illusion that tasks are occurring simultaneously. 
  - If there are multiple cores then it can be the case that the tasks are literally executing concurrently.

##### 4.2. Threads in Java

- Thread class

  - When the user runs a Java program, the JVM itself creates a number of threads. 

    > i.e., The programmer doesn’t need to explicitly create threads.

  - Ways to implement thread

    > There are some reasons to implement `Runnable` rather than extend `Thread`.
    >
    > - When you extend `Thread` you are using that class directly to create a new thread. 
    >   - This means that each time you create a different thread object you get exactly that: a different thread, and the thread management code and thread behaviour are coupled in the same object. 
    >   - This means you can’t share the behaviour part of the different threads: each has their own.
    > - On the other hand, if you have a class that implements `Runnable` you can create an object of that type and pass the same object to multiple threads. 
    >   - This makes data sharing between the threads much easier since they are all accessing the same Runnable object.
    >
    > In general, this type of decoupling is a good thing anyway. In this case, the `Thread` class provides the vehicle and the `Runnable` provides the the behaviour.

    1. Create **a new class** that extends the `Thread` class and then to override the `run()` method in this new class.

       - Note that we do not call the `run()` method ourselves. We call the `start()` method. The `run()` method will be called, at some point, by the JVM.
       - The `run()` method of the `ExtendThreadExample` class simply prints out two lines of text to the console and then exits. 

       >e.g.
       >
       >```java
       >public class ExtendThreadExample extends Thread {
       >       @Override
       >       public void run() {
       >          System.out.println("ExtendThreadExample run method
       >             has started.");
       >          System.out.println("ExtendThreadExample run method
       >             has ended.");
       >       }
       >       public static void main(String[] args) {
       >          ExtendThreadExample thread = new
       >             ExtendThreadExample();
       >          thread.start();
       >       }
       >}
       >```
       >
       >This program creates an object of type `ExtendThreadExample` and then calls the `start()` method on that object. This causes the thread to start executing.

    2. To create a class that implements the `Runnable` **interface**.

       - With this approach we are forced to override the `run()` method *(in the previous example that was optional but necessary)* since `run()` is now an interface method.

       >e.g.
       >
       >```java
       >public class RunnableExample implements Runnable {
       >       @Override
       >       public void run() {
       >         System.out.println("RunnableExample run method has
       >             started.");
       >         System.out.println("RunnableExample run method has
       >             ended.");
       >       }
       >       public static void main(String[] args) {
       >         Thread thread = new Thread(new RunnableExample());
       >         thread.start();
       >} }
       >```
       >
       >In this case, to create the thread we must use the `Thread` class as shown. We pass to the `Thread` constructor an instance of our `Runnable` class. This creates a thread based on our `Runnable`.
       >
       >We then call `start()` on our Thread object. This will cause the `RunnableExample` `run()` method to be called, at some point.

    3. Implement the `Runnable` as a **lambda expression**.

       - Offers the advantage of a more concise syntax. 
       - `Runnable` is an example of what is called a functional interface 
         - An interface with only <u>one abstract method</u>. You will notice in the example that the method name run is not mentioned anywhere. 
         - This is because it is implied by the fact that there is only one method in the interface (it is a functional interface) and that method does not receive any parameters (which is why the parentheses are empty).

       > e.g. 
       >
       > ```java
       >  public class LambdaExample {
       >       public static void main(String[] args) {
       >          Runnable runnable = () -> {
       >             System.out.println("LambdaExample run method has started.");
       >             System.out.println("LambdaExample run method has ended."); 
       >          };
       >          Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
       >          thread.start();
       >       }
       > }
       > ```

- Creating threads

  - Process

    1. When we run these programs

       - The JVM starts a *Main thread* for the program, 

       - Then also creates the thread that we have introduced ourselves.

    2. The Main thread and our new thread are two independent threads. 
       - Neither owns or is owned by the other. The OS will manage both of them. 
       - Our new thread does not 'belong' to the Main thread.

  - Orders
    - Each thread created in a Java program, hence by the JVM, is independent. Not only do they not always start in the order we might expect, their execution is interleaved too.
    - The OS is using preemptive scheduling so it interrupts one thread to run another.

##### 4.3. Thread cooperation

- Definition

  - The OS will use whichever scheduling algorithm it applies to the threads that are running. 

    > i.e. Threads will have their <u>execution preempted</u> to allow other threads to run.

  - When we create thread classes we will have a good idea of the behaviour and requirements of that thread class. 

    - <u>Not all</u> thread classes require the same access to the CPU. 
    - We can make our threads cooperative in this way: acknowledging when they don’t need to use the CPU as much as some other threads.

    > e.g.
    >
    > A class that is responsible for some background task, *e.g. downloading updates*, doesn’t necessarily need much priority in terms of CPU time.

##### 4.4. Pausing a thread

- For thread cooperation, `Thread` class provide the ability to put a thread to ‘sleep’, **i.e. pause the thread**.

  - Because your thread needs to perform a regular task but doesn’t need to spend all that much time doing it, or if the task is relatively non-urgent.
  - Because you may need a thread to wait for a period of time.

- There is a static method in the `Thread` class for this. It takes a parameter specifying the number of milliseconds that the thread should sleep for. The timings are approximate.

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```java
  > public class SleepExample implements Runnable { @Override
  > 	public void run() { System.out.println("SleepExample run method hasstarted.");
  > 	try { Thread.sleep(2000)
  >   } catch (InterruptedException e) { 
  >     e.printStackTrace();
  >   }
  >   System.out.println("SleepExample run method has ended.");
  > 	}
  >   
  > 	public static void main(String[] args) {
  >     Thread thread = new Thread(new SleepExample()); 
  >     thread.start();
  > 	} 
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > 

##### 4.5. Stopping a thread

- As a Java program reaches the end of its `main()` method it terminates. In the case of threads, when a thread reaches the end of its `run()` method it terminates.

- If we want a thread to continue to execute, for some perhaps indeterminate period, we need to make sure it doesn’t exit its `run()` method until we are ready.

  > Note:
  >
  > In the Thread class there is actually a method called `stop()`. This method is deprecated, however. The reason it is considered best not to use it, is that it leaves your thread, hence your application, in an indeterminate state.
  >
  > It is better to control the execution of your threads yourself, and to make sure they exit when you are ready for them to do so. For this we can <u>simply use a boolean</u>.

  > e.g. The `run()` method
  >
  > ```java
  > public void run() {
  >   System.out.println("SleepExample run method has started.");
  >   
  >   while (!stopped) {
  >     System.out.println("Executing run method.");
  >     try {
  >       Thread.sleep(1000);
  >     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
  >       e.printStackTrace();
  >     } 
  >   }
  >   
  >   System.out.println("Stop has been requested.");
  > }
  > ```

  > e.g. The boolean
  >
  > ```java
  > private boolean stopped = false;
  > public boolean isStopped() {
  >    return stopped;
  > }
  > public void setStopped() {
  >    this.stopped = true;
  > }
  > ```
