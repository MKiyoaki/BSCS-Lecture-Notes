### 4. Multithreading

##### 4.1. Definition

- We can now create multithreaded programs - Programs in which there are multiple threads of execution occurring *at the same time*.
- Considering on CPUs
  - If there is a single core, then multithreading creates the illusion that tasks are occurring simultaneously. 
  - If there are multiple cores then it can be the case that the tasks are literally executing concurrently.

##### 4.2. Threads in Java

- Thread class

  - When the user runs a Java program, the JVM itself creates a number of threads. 

    > i.e., The programmer doesn’t need to explicitly create threads.

  - Ways to implement thread

    > There are some reasons to implement `Runnable` rather than extend `Thread`.
    >
    > - When you extend `Thread` you are using that class directly to create a new thread. 
    >   - This means that each time you create a different thread object you get exactly that: a different thread, and the thread management code and thread behaviour are coupled in the same object. 
    >   - This means you can’t share the behaviour part of the different threads: each has their own.
    > - On the other hand, if you have a class that implements `Runnable` you can create an object of that type and pass the same object to multiple threads. 
    >   - This makes data sharing between the threads much easier since they are all accessing the same Runnable object.
    >
    > In general, this type of decoupling is a good thing anyway. In this case, the `Thread` class provides the vehicle and the `Runnable` provides the the behaviour.

    1. Create **a new class** that extends the `Thread` class and then to override the `run()` method in this new class.

       - Note that we do not call the `run()` method ourselves. We call the `start()` method. The `run()` method will be called, at some point, by the JVM.
       - The `run()` method of the `ExtendThreadExample` class simply prints out two lines of text to the console and then exits. 

       >e.g.
       >
       >```java
       >public class ExtendThreadExample extends Thread {
       >  @Override
       >  public void run() {
       >     System.out.println("ExtendThreadExample run method
       >        has started.");
       >     System.out.println("ExtendThreadExample run method
       >        has ended.");
       >  }
       >  public static void main(String[] args) {
       >     ExtendThreadExample thread = new
       >        ExtendThreadExample();
       >     thread.start();
       >  }
       >}
       >```
       >
       >This program creates an object of type `ExtendThreadExample` and then calls the `start()` method on that object. This causes the thread to start executing.

    2. To create a class that implements the `Runnable` **interface**.

       - With this approach we are forced to override the `run()` method *(in the previous example that was optional but necessary)* since `run()` is now an interface method.

       >e.g.
       >
       >```java
       >public class RunnableExample implements Runnable {
       >  @Override
       >  public void run() {
       >    System.out.println("RunnableExample run method has
       >        started.");
       >    System.out.println("RunnableExample run method has
       >        ended.");
       >  }
       >  public static void main(String[] args) {
       >    Thread thread = new Thread(new RunnableExample());
       >    thread.start();
       >} }
       >```
       >
       >In this case, to create the thread we must use the `Thread` class as shown. We pass to the `Thread` constructor an instance of our `Runnable` class. This creates a thread based on our `Runnable`.
       >
       >We then call `start()` on our Thread object. This will cause the `RunnableExample` `run()` method to be called, at some point.

    3. Implement the `Runnable` as a **lambda expression**.

       - Offers the advantage of a more concise syntax. 
       - `Runnable` is an example of what is called a functional interface 
         - An interface with only <u>one abstract method</u>. You will notice in the example that the method name run is not mentioned anywhere. 
         - This is because it is implied by the fact that there is only one method in the interface (it is a functional interface) and that method does not receive any parameters (which is why the parentheses are empty).

       > e.g. 
       >
       > ```java
       > public class LambdaExample {
       >    public static void main(String[] args) {
       >       Runnable runnable = () -> {
       >          System.out.println("LambdaExample run method has started.");
       >          System.out.println("LambdaExample run method has ended."); 
       >       };
       >       Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
       >       thread.start();
       >    }
       > }
       > ```

- Creating threads

  - Process

    1. When we run these programs

       - The JVM starts a *Main thread* for the program, 

       - Then also creates the thread that we have introduced ourselves.

    2. The Main thread and our new thread are two independent threads. 
       - Neither owns or is owned by the other. The OS will manage both of them. 
       - Our new thread does not 'belong' to the Main thread.

  - Orders
    - Each thread created in a Java program, hence by the JVM, is independent. Not only do they not always start in the order we might expect, their execution is interleaved too.
    - The OS is using preemptive scheduling so it interrupts one thread to run another.

##### 4.3. Thread cooperation

- Definition

  - The OS will use whichever scheduling algorithm it applies to the threads that are running. 

    > i.e. Threads will have their <u>execution preempted</u> to allow other threads to run.

  - When we create thread classes we will have a good idea of the behaviour and requirements of that thread class. 

    - <u>Not all</u> thread classes require the same access to the CPU. 
    - We can make our threads cooperative in this way: acknowledging when they don’t need to use the CPU as much as some other threads.

    > e.g.
    >
    > A class that is responsible for some background task, *e.g. downloading updates*, doesn’t necessarily need much priority in terms of CPU time.

##### 4.4. Pausing a thread

- For thread cooperation, `Thread` class provide the ability to put a thread to ‘sleep’, **i.e. pause the thread**.

  - Because your thread needs to perform a regular task but doesn’t need to spend all that much time doing it, or if the task is relatively non-urgent.
  - Because you may need a thread to wait for a period of time.

- There is a static method in the `Thread` class for this. It takes a parameter specifying the number of milliseconds that the thread should sleep for. The timings are approximate.

  > e.g.
  >
  > ```java
  > public class SleepExample implements Runnable { @Override
  > 	public void run() { System.out.println("SleepExample run method hasstarted.");
  > 	try { Thread.sleep(2000)
  > } catch (InterruptedException e) { 
  >  e.printStackTrace();
  > }
  > System.out.println("SleepExample run method has ended.");
  > 	}
  > 
  > 	public static void main(String[] args) {
  >  Thread thread = new Thread(new SleepExample()); 
  >  thread.start();
  > 	} 
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > 

##### 4.5. Stopping a thread

- As a Java program reaches the end of its `main()` method it terminates. In the case of threads, when a thread reaches the end of its `run()` method it terminates.

- If we want a thread to continue to execute, for some perhaps indeterminate period, we need to make sure it doesn’t exit its `run()` method until we are ready.

  > Note:
  >
  > In the Thread class there is actually a method called `stop()`. This method is deprecated, however. The reason it is considered best not to use it, is that it leaves your thread, hence your application, in an indeterminate state.
  >
  > It is better to control the execution of your threads yourself, and to make sure they exit when you are ready for them to do so. For this we can <u>simply use a boolean</u>.

  > e.g. The `run()` method
  >
  > ```java
  > public void run() {
  > System.out.println("SleepExample run method has started.");
  > 
  > while (!stopped) {
  >  System.out.println("Executing run method.");
  >  try {
  >    Thread.sleep(1000);
  >  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
  >    e.printStackTrace();
  >  } 
  > }
  > 
  > System.out.println("Stop has been requested.");
  > }
  > ```

  > e.g. The boolean
  >
  > ```java
  > private boolean stopped = false;
  > public boolean isStopped() {
  >   return stopped;
  > }
  > public void setStopped() {
  >   this.stopped = true;
  > }
  > ```

##### 4.6. Thread independence

- Daemon thread

  - If we want to ensure that a thread exits when the <u>Main thread exits</u> then we can make it a **daemon thread**. 

    ```java
    thread.setDaemon(true);
    ```

  - Before the thread is started, this will ensure that when the Main thread exits, so does the thread.

- Join method

  - It is sometimes the case that there needs to be some coordination between threads in terms of their execution. However, one thread might need to wait until another thread has completed.

    > e.g.
    >
    > If the second thread is computing some value that the first thread needs and can’t proceed without.

  - If thread *A* calls `join()` on thread *B*, thread *A* will block (wait) until thread *B* terminates.

    >e.g.
    >
    >```java
    >public class JoinExample implements Runnable { 
    >private float result;
    >
    >public void run() {
    >float temp = 0.0f; float inc = 0.001f;
    >for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { 
    > temp += inc;
    > try {
    >   Thread.sleep(10);
    > } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    >   e.printStackTrace(); 
    > }
    >}
    >result = temp; 
    >}
    >
    >public float getResult() { 
    >return result;
    >}
    >
    >public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    >  JoinExample runnable = new JoinExample();
    >  Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
    >  thread.start();
    >  System.out.println("Waiting for thread to terminate."); 
    >  thread.join();
    >  System.out.println("Thread terminated."); 
    >}
    >}
    >```

### 5. Java Memory Model

> When a process is started it gets a number of memory segments. The code and the global data/constants are copied from the executable file, and the OS allocates two areas of memory exclusive to the process: the stack and the heap.
>
> When a process creates threads, each thread gets its own, exclusive stack, but shares the heap with the process and all other threads started by the process.
>
> This sharing of the heap means that we can very easily share data between threads.

##### 5.1. Primitives, references and objects

- Creating objects
  - When you create a **primitive type variable** *(int, boolean, etc.)* as a local variable or method parameter, these are stored on the stack of the running thread.
  - When you create an object, it creates two things: a reference and the object itself. 
    - If you create **an object** in this manner in a method then the reference will be stored on the *stack* but the object itself will be stored on the *heap*.
    - If you pass **a reference** to an object as a method parameter, again, the reference goes on the *stack* but the object itself will be on the *heap*.
- Object contain primitive values
  - The primitive value could be a part of the object so it stored on the *heap*, with the rest of the object’s fields.
  - It is also typical for objects to contain references to other objects. In this case, the reference is stored, **as part of the object**, on the *heap*. The object that the reference is referring to will be stored elsewhere on the *heap*.

##### 5.2. Example: The Evaluator program

>```java
>// The Operation class represents a simple arithmetic operation.
>public class Operation {
>	private int value1;
>	private int value2;
>	private String operator = "NOT_SET";
>public Operation (int v1, int v2, String op) { 
>value1 = v1;
>value2 = v2;
>operator = op;
>}
>public int getValue1() {
>return value1; 
>}
>public int getValue2() { 
>return value2;
>}
>public String getOperator() {
>return operator; 
>}
>public String toString() {
>return getValue1() + " " + getOperator() + " " + getValue2();
>}
>}
>
>// The Evaluator class evaluates operations.
>public class Evaluator3 {
>private Operation op;
>public Evaluator3(Operation op) {
>this.op = op;
>}
>public float evaluate(Message message) {
>float result = Float.MIN_VALUE;
>message.setMessage("NOT_SUPPORTED"); // default message
>if (op.getOperator().equals("*")) {
> result = op.getValue1() * op.getValue2();
> message.setMessage("SUCCESS");
>}
>return result;
>}
>}
>
>// The Message class represents a simple string message.
>public class Message {
>private String message;
>public Message() {
>message = "NOT_SET";
>}
>public String getMessage() {
>return message;
>}
>public void setMessage(String m) {
>message = m;
>}
>}
>
>// The program below simply uses the classes above to perform a simple operation.
>public class Main3 {
>public static void main(String[] args) {
>int op1 = 2;
>int op2 = 5;
>String operation = "*";
>Operation op = new Operation(op1, op2, operation);
>Message message = new Message();
>float result = new Evaluator3(op).evaluate(message);
>System.out.println(result + " " + message.getMessage());
>} 
>}
>```
>
>Start with `Main3` class which contains the `main()` method: 
>
>1. The JVM will start a thread to run this program. 
>
>2. The *line 62* creates a reference called op that is stored on the *stack*, and an object of type `Operation` that is stored on the *heap*.
>
>  ```java
>Operation op = new Operation(op1, op2, operation);
>  ```
>
>3. In `Operation` class:
>
>  - The three instance variables are declared at class scope therefore are a part of the object and will be put on the heap as part of the object’s memory footprint
>
>  - So, the *String* reference operator <u>is placed on the *heap*</u> with the other variables. The *String* literal "NOT_SET", which is an object, <u>will also be placed on the *heap*</u> but in an area reserved for String literals.
>
>    ```java
>    private int value1;
>    private int value2;
>    private String operator = "NOT_SET";
>    ```
>
>3. For the constructor of `Operation`: 
>
>  - After invoking from the `main()` method, the three parameters have been pushed onto the *stack*. In the case of the *String* parameter, <u>only the reference has been pushed onto the stack</u>, not the object. 
>
>  - The constructor does not create any further local variables so all that happens is the three assignment operations. i.e., The values in the object (this) are changed (on the *heap*) to the values in the three parameters.
>
>4. The *line 64* creates a local variable result that will be stored on the stack. 
>
>  - Also creates a new Evaluator which is stored on the heap (the address of this object is known to the JVM, of course, despite there being no reference created)
>
>  - Then the evaluate() method is called with the message parameter the purpose of which is to get a success or error message back from the method.
>
>    ```java
>    float result = new Evaluator3(op).evaluate(message);
>    ```
>
>5. Finally, consider the `evaluate()` method.
>
>  - The final point to note is that this method receives a Message object reference. The reference is pushed onto the stack whilst, as we now know, the object itself is stored on the heap. The reference message is actually a copy of the reference. Since a reference is an address of an object, this means that the method receives the address of the object.
>  - The effect of this is when this method calls a mutator method using that reference, as it does with message.setMessage(‘‘SUCCESS’’), the object itself is changed.
>  - Thus we are able to create an object outside of the `evaluate()` method, pass it to the method, and then see the results of changes to that object after the `evaluate()` method has ended, back in the main() method.

##### 5.3. Implications for threads

- Example

  >```java
  >public class MemoryDemoRunnable implements Runnable {
  >private int counter = 0;
  >public void run() {
  >for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
  > counter++;
  >}
  >System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " " + counter);
  >}
  >
  >public static void main(String[] args) {
  >MemoryDemoRunnable runnable1 = new MemoryDemoRunnable();
  >Thread thread1 = new Thread(runnable1);
  >MemoryDemoRunnable runnable2 = new MemoryDemoRunnable();
  >Thread thread2 = new Thread(runnable2);
  >thread1.start();
  >thread2.start();
  >} 
  >}
  >```
  >
  >The output will be 
  >
  >```java
  >// Possible output 1
  >Thread-0 100000
  >Thread-1 100000
  >
  >// Possible output 2
  >Thread-1 100000
  >Thread-0 100000
  >```
  >
  >- Objects
  >  - Two objects of type `Runnable` are created. These objects will be stored on the heap for the process, whilst the two references are stored on the stack of the main thread.
  >  - Consider the layout of `MemoryDemoRunnable` itself. It has a run() method that creates a local variable called i, that is used as an index for the loop, and is stored on the stack of whichever thread is executing (Thread-0 or Thread-1).
  >  - The two threads have different instances of i, distinct to each other and distinct between `run()` method calls even of the same thread.

- Counters

  - This variable is an instance variable so it is not a local variable but it is distinct between different objects of MemoryDemoRunnable class.
  - However, between different calls to `run()` the value of counter persists.
  - The crucial point here is that the variable counter is not being shared by the two threads since they are running distinct Runnable objects.

- Shared Objects

  - Consider what happens if objects are shared between threads. *i.e., The `Runnable` object for this example.* 
    - We might wish both threads to use the same Runnable object if, for example, they are cooperating on some task.
    - We make the simple change to the program shown on the next slide. Now only one Runnable object is created.
  - Effeciency
    - Potentially, we could expect the counter to reach 200,000 since each thread is independently iterating 100,000 times and there are two threads.
    - In practice, this won’t happen. The problem is that the two threads will interfere with each other. The value of the counter will depend on when each of the two threads access it and change its value.

- Non-atomic operations

  - The `++` operator involves **three separate operations** but not atomic actually. 
    1. read the value, 
    2. increment the value, 
    3. write the value.
  - This is a problem because, in this example, the threads might overlap in their execution of `counter++` due to them being interrupted by each other.

- Race conditions

  - In our example, Thread-0 could initiate the counter++ operation and read the existing value. At this point it could be interrupted by Thread-1 which also starts the operation and reads the existing value: the same value that Thread-0 read.

  - Thread-1 then increments the counter and writes the value back to memory. At this point, Thread-0 resumes, increments its value of the counter and writes that back. This causes a lost update because Thread-0 overwrites the value created by Thread-1.

  - If the two threads had executed sequentially (which we assume for now was the logic of this operation rather than a mistake), then we would expect both increments to be recognised and the value of the counter to have increased by two.

  - Such a scenario is called a race condition and is a common issue in computer science. It is a race because the end result of an operation depends on a race between the threads, rather than on the logic of the program.

    > e.g.
    >
    > ```java
    > Thread-0 125520
    > Thread-1 129595
    > Thread-1 107462
    > Thread-0 137097
    > Thread-0 148311
    > Thread-1 148311
    > ```
    >
    > We can see that the result is indeterminate. We can’t be sure what the result will be because it depends on the order in which the threads perform their operations.
