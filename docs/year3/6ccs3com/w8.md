### 8.1. Introduction to Interaction Nets

##### 8.1.1. Components

- Agents

  - *Agents* are nodes with:
    - One principal port (an outgoing edge depicted with an arrow).
    - A set of n auxiliary ports (other connected edges, ordered). 
    - A type that determines its interactions (node symbol).
  - Agents correspond with **functions**.

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  	x1 --- a((α))
  	x2 --- a
  ```

- Nets

  - An *interaction net* is a graph of agents, where agents are connected at their ports.
    - Ports are connected **1-to-1**.
    - If a port is not connected to another agent then we say it is **free**.
    - The **interface** of a net is its set of free ports.
  - Two special nets: the **empty** net and **wirings** (nets with only edges)
  - Nets correspond with **programs**.

- Active Pairs

  -  A pair of agents which are connected by their primary ports are called an **active pair**.
  - Active pairs are the redexes of interaction nets: where all the computation happens.

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
  	alpha((α)) <--> beta((β))
  ```

- Interaction Rules

  - An interaction rule replaces an active pair of agents $(α,β)$ by a new net $N$.
  - The new net must have the <u>same interface</u> as the active pair.
  - There can be at most one interaction rule for each pair of agent types.
  - Reduction is **local**, only the agents in the active pair are rewritten.
  
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    	x1 --- a((α))
    	... --- a
    	xn --- a
    	a <--> b((β))
    	b --- y1
    	b --- ...2[...]
    	b --- yn
    ```

    > 	... --- N
    > 	xn --- N
    > 	N --- y1
    > 	N --- ...2[...]
    > 	N --- yn
    > ```

>
> Natural numbers can be defined over a 0 agent and the *successor* agent $S$.

> 	03((0)) --> s2((s)) --> s3((s)) --> empty2[empty]
> ```

##### 8.1.3. Erasing and Duplication Agents

- Definition

  - Two common agents in many Interaction Nets are the **Erasing** ($ε$) and **Duplicating** ($δ$) agents, with the following interaction rules.

  - Earsing:

      ```mermaid
      graph LR
      	  x1 --> alpha
      	  ... --> alpha
      	  xn --> alpha
      	  alpha((α)) <--> erase((ε))
      ```

      > equivalent to
      >
      > ```mermaid
      > graph TD
      > 	e1((ε)) --> x1
      > 	e2((ε)) --> ...
      > 	e3((ε)) --> xn
      > ```

    - The erasing agent is helpful to erase sub-nets (e.g. $x_1 \to x_n$).
    
  - Duplicating
  
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
      	  x1 --- alpha
      	  ... --- alpha
      	  xn --- alpha
      	  alpha((α)) <--> delta((δ))
      	  delta --- d1
      	  delta --- d2
    ```
  
    > equivalent to
    >
    > ```mermaid
    > graph TD
    > 	a1((α)) --> delta1((δ))
    > 	a2((α)) --> delta1
    > 	a1((α)) ~~~ delta2((δ))
    > 	a2((α)) ~~~ delta2
    > 	a1((α)) --> deltan((δ))
    > 	a2((α)) --> deltan
    > 	
    > 	delta1 --> x1
    > 	delta2 --> ...
    > 	deltan --> xn
    > 	
    > 	a1 --- d1
    > 	a2 --- d2
    > ```
  
    - The duplicating agent is helpful to copy the same operation (e.g. $α$) to two sub-nets (e.g. $d_1, d_2$).

  > 	m <--> S((S))

  > e.g.
  >
  > Maximum
  >
  > The maximum function is typically defined as follows: 
  >
  > 1. $\max(0,y) = y$
  > 2. $\max(x,0) = x$
  > 3. $\max(S(x), S(y)) = S(\max(x,y))$
  >
  > However, this specification can’t be implemented directly into interaction nets: it is defined by cases on both of the arguments.  This would require two principal ports for the max agent.
  >
  > So, we use this definition instead:
  >
  > 1. $\max(0,y) = y$
  > 2. $\max(S(x), y) = \max'(x, y)$
  > 3. $\max'(x,0) = S(x)$
  > 4. $\max'(x, S(y)) = S(\max(x, y))$

##### 8.1.4. Computational properties

- Non-Termination

  - Normal form: stop when they are no more active pairs.
    - It defines when to stop applying interaction rules to a net.
    - But not all nets have a normal form.
  - Interaction nets can be **non-terminating**.

- Confluence

  - Interaction nets have **strong** confluence (the diamond property).
  - If $A$ and $B$ are interaction nets, we use $A \implies B$ to denote that $B$ can be obtained through a single interaction rule from $A$.
  - The property of strong confluence tells us:
    - If $M \implies M_1, M \implies M_2$, then there exists a term $M_3$ such that $M_1 \implies M_3$ and $M_2 \implies M_3$.
  - This property makes interaction nets suitable for representing **distributed computations**, since computational steps can take place in **parallel**.

- Non-determistic extension

  - Interaction Nets are inherently **deterministic**.

    - Although there can be many active pairs, they can be reduced in any order without changing the result.

  - Possible non-deterministic extensions include:

    1. Allowing multiple interaction rules for each pair of agents, from swhich one will be chosen at random for each active pair.
    2. Allowing edges that connect more than two ports, where the branch is chosen at random.
    3. Allowing agents to have multiple principal ports (known as *ambiguous agents*).

  - In fact, it is sufficient to just add one ambiguous agent, amb, which has two principal ports.

    -  If an `amb` agent forms two active pairs, then the interaction to be resolved is chosen at random.

    - `amb` agent:

      > ...

- Computation Power

  - Any computation that can be encoded by Turing Machines or The Lambda Calculus can be encoded by Interaction Nets.
  - Therefore, Interaction Nets are a computationally equivalent model of computation.
  - Proof intuition: Interaction Nets can simulate The Lambda Calculus and vice-versa.
