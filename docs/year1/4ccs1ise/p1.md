## PART I - Software Engineering

> Outlines: 
>
> The basical concepts of Software and Software Engineering, including the types and the developing lifecycle

#### 1. Objectives 

- Essential attributes of good software 
  - Maintainability
  - Dependability and security
  - Efficiency
  - Acceptability

#### 2. Types

- Stand-alone application

  Not need to be connected to a network
- Interactive transaction-based application

  Is executed remotely, accessed by users’ own PCs
- Embedded control systems

  To manage hardware devices

#### 3. Software Development Lifecycle - SDLC

##### 3.1. Feasibility Analysis

- Ask for

  - Business need 
  - Technical feasibility 
  - Financial feasibility 
  - Time 
  - Resources 
  
- Get

  - Feasibility **report**

##### 3.2. Requirements Analysis

- Stages

  1. Domain analysis to get the requirement
  2. Evaluation and negotiation
  3. Specification and documentation
  4. Validation and verification
  
- Techniques

  - Interviews
  - Document mining
  - Goal decomposition
  - Exploratory prototyping

##### 3.3. Architecture & Design

- 4+1 Model

  - Logical
  - Process
  - Physical
  - Development
  - Scenarios
  
- Design
  - Risk/Value Driven
  - Use UML
  - High-level analysis
  - Produces understanding

##### 3.4. Implementation
Configuration management (CM)

- Concerned with policies, processes and tools for managing software systems

  - Activities
    - Version management
    - System building
    - Changing management
    - Release management
    
  - Types
    - Centralised
    - Distributed
    
  - Terminologies
    - `Baseline` - Like master branch
    - `Codeline` - Like branches
    - `Mainline` - A sequence of baselines show different versions
    - `Branching` - Separate to different versions
    - `Merging` - Merge multiple versions to one version
    
- Testing

  - Goal - Debug
  - Type
    - White-box testing
    > Know the source code
    - Black-box testing 
    > Don’t know the source code
  - Stage
  
    - Alpha / $\alpha$ - development
    Levels
    > - Unit tests
    > - Integration/Components tests
    > - System test
    - Beta / $\beta$ - release version
    - Gamma / $\gamma$ - user test
  
- Deployment & Maintenance
