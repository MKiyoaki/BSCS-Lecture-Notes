### 9. Recap for Induction

##### 9.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

- Induction

  - For any property $P(n)$ of natural numbers *(i.e. $n ∈ \mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,...\}$)*, to prove $∀n ∈ \mathbb{N}.P(n)$​ it is sufficient to show that

    - Base Case: $P(0)$
    - Induction Step: $∀n ∈ \mathbb{N} .P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$​​


  > e.g.
  >
  > We prove that for all natural numbers $n$ that $\Sigma^n_{i=1}(2i-1)=n^2$
  >
  > - Base: $0=0^2$
  >
  > - Induction: 
  >
  >   Assume $\Sigma^n_{i=1}(2i-1)=n^2$​​
  > 
  >   $\Sigma^{n+1}_{i=1}(2i-1)=\Sigma^n_{i=1}(2i-1)+2(n+1)-1=n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$

- Structural Induction

  - We denote an empty list by $\text{nil}$, and a non-empty list by $\text{cons}(h,l)$ where $h$ is the head element and $l$ is the tail of the list.
  - To prove that a property $P$ holds for every list, it is sufficient to prove that
    - Base Case: $P(\text{nil})$
    - Induction Step: $P(l) \implies P(\text{cons}(h,l)) \text{ for all }h, l$​  
  - More generally, if we are working with finite labelled trees and we want to prove a property $P$ for those trees, it is sufficient to show that
    - Base Case: $P(l)$ for all leaf nodes $l$
    - Induction Step: for each tree constructor $c (\text{with } n ≥ 1 \text{ arguments}): ∀t_1, . . . , tn.P(t_1) ∧ ... ∧ P(t_n) ⇒ P(c(t_1, ... , t_n))$​

  > e.g.
  >
  > To prove that a property $P$​ holds for all integer expressions in SIMP
  >
  > - Base: 
  >   - Prove $P(n) \text{ for all } n∈\mathbb{Z}$​
  >   - Prove $P(!l) \text{ for all locations }l$
  > - Induction: 
  >   - For all integer expressions $E, E'$ and operators $op$, Prove that $P(E), P(E') \implies P(E\ op\ E')$

- Remark

  - The principle of structural induction can be justified by the principle of mathematical induction. 
  - This is because we work with *finite* trees, so we can understand structural induction as induction on the *size* of the tree.


##### 9.2. Application of the Structural Induction Principle

- Property
  - The semantics of SIMP guarantees that for any integer expression $E$ appearing in a program working on a memory $m$, if $E$ uses locations that are defined in $m$ then the value of $E$​ is defined.
  - i.e., For any configuration $⟨E · c , r , m⟩$ where $c$ is any arbitrary control stack and $r$ is also arbitrary, there is a configuration $⟨c,n·r,m⟩$ such that $⟨E·c,r,m⟩ \rightarrow^∗ ⟨c,n·r,m⟩$​.
