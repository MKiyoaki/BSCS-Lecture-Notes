### 8.1. Introduction to Support Vector Machines

##### 8.1.1. Motivation

- Definition
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based on *Linear Discriminant Functions*
    - Include margins to optimise solution
    - Can allow errors to occur in a controlled way
  - Comparable to Neural Networks
    - Allow non-linear mappings in higher dimensional feature space through use of Kernel functions
    - Advantages over NNs as simpler to select models and less susceptible to over-fitting

##### 8.1.2. Linearly Separable
