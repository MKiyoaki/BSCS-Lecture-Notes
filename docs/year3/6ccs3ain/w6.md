### 6.1. Introduction

##### 6.1.1. Consensus Mechanism

- Definition
  - Context
    - Multiagent systems where agents are connected to each other. This can be represented as a graph.
      - Agents are programed with the same program.
      - With agents as nodes, and the connections between them as edges
      - We use the terms *agent* and *node* interchangeably.
    - Each agent can take a finite number of states
    - Interactions proceed in a series of rounds
      - Each round, each agent has to decide what state to be in. 
      - Agents make their decision according to an algorithm.
      - All agents are using the same algorithm. 
      - The algorithm may first check the colours of the neighbours in the previous round.
    - Assume the agents share a common goal to achieve an overall configuration of states
- Application
  - Robot bucket brigades
  - Consensus in distributed systems
  - Designing and managing swarms
