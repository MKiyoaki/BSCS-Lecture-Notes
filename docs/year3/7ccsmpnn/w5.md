### 5.1. Deep Neural Networks

##### 5.1.1. Introduction to Deep Neural Networks

- Definition
  - A *deep* network is a neural network with more than 3 layers. Typically far more than 3 layers.
  - A *shallow* network is a neural network with less or qual than 3 layers.
  - The term **deep learning** refers to the process of training a deep neural network. 
- Motivation
  - Three-layer nerual networks are able to approximate any continuous non-linear function arbitrarily well.
    - Universal function approximators.
    - Can solve any pattern recognition task, in theory
  - However, to solve complex tasks (i.e., perform complex mapping), we need larger networks with more parameters. 
  - The success of VGGNet shows that <u>a deep network ususally has a better performance than a wide network</u>. 
- Deep Networks
  - Deep network aims to provide a hierarchy of representations with increasing level of abstraction.
    - It is the natural of dealing with many tasks.
  - Deep network allows **recurrent structures**. i.e., Recurrent nerual networks (RNNs). 
    - Recurrent networks process temporal information, where the value of $\textbf{x}$ changes over time. 
    - Training a recurrent network is achieved by unfolding the network and using backpropagation on the unfold network. 
    - There is one layer in the unfolded network for each time-step, so recurrent networks for processing long sequences are equivalent to very deep networks.
