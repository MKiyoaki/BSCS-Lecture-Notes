#### 1. Introduction to projects & project management

###### 1.1. Definition

- `Project` - a temporary process undertaken to <u>create a unique product</u>
  - Difference from operations
    - Projects are **unique & temporary**
    - Projects have **specific goals** and a **defined beginning and end**

###### 1.2. Issues in project management

- `Constraints` - Limitations in resources *like time, budget and scope*
- `People` - Managing and coordinating *team members* with diverse skills and ways of working
- `Communcation` - Ensuring effective *information flow*, avoiding breakdowns
- `Risk` - Identifying, assessing, and mitigating *potential issues*

###### 1.3. Project Life Cycle

- Initiating - clearly defining the <u>scope and purpose</u> of a project

- Planning - establishing <u>detailed plans</u> for how the project will be executed

- Executing - coordinating people and resources to <u>carry out the project plan</u>

- Monitoring & controlling - tracking, reviewing, and regulating progress and

  performance

- Closing - <u>finalizing</u> all project activities and completing deliverables

#### 2. Project Constraints

###### 2.1. Definition

- `Project Constraints` 
  - A limitation or restriction that hinders the flexibility of a project. 
  - Can arise from various factors, *including project scope budget, time, resources, quality, and risk*. 

###### 2.2. Recognition

- Recognizing factors that define the parameters within which a project must operate
  - Affecting its scope, 
  - schedule, 
  - budget, 
  - or quality

###### 2.3. Models of project constraints

- Iron Triangle 

  - Components - Time, cost, scope.

  - Concept

    <u>Changing one element affects the others</u>, demonstrating the interdependence of constraints, with a delicate balance between them

- Diamond Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, and quality.
  - Concept
    - Quality is added as a core constraint, emphasizing its importance in project management.
    - Recognizes that <u>a project may fail</u> despite meeting time and cost constraints if it lacks quality.

- PMBOK Model

  - Components - Time, cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and stakeholders.
  - Concept
    - Includes a broader set of constraints, incorporating stakeholders and risk as crucial elements.
    - Acknowledges that project success is influenced by a broader set of factors beyond the traditional three constraints.

###### 2.4. Types of project constraints

> Different constraints are interconnected; altering one may affect others. 
>
> For example, increasing scope might impact cost and time

- **Cost/Budget Constraint** - Limitation on the <u>financial resources</u> available.
- **Time/Schedule Constraint** - Restrictions on the project's <u>timeline</u>.
- **Scope Constraint** - <u>Boundaries</u> defining what is and isn't part of the project.
- **Quality Constraint** - The standard of deliverables and project outcomes.
- **Risk Constraint** - <u>Potential threats</u> that may impact project success.
- **Resource Constraint** - Limitation on <u>people, equipment, or materials</u>. 

###### 2.5. Costs Constraints

- Types
  - `Direct costs` - Directly attributable to the project *(e.g., software development tools)*.
  - `Indirect costs` - Not project-specific but contribute to overall expenses *(e.g., office utilities)*.
- Why is costing a project difficult
  - **Evolving Requirements** - Software <u>requirements may change</u> over time, affecting project scope and thus costs.
  - **Uncertainties in Technology** - Rapid <u>technological advancements</u> can introduce unforeseen complexities and cost implications.
- Recognizing Cost constraints
  - **Thorough Cost Estimation** - Conduct comprehensive cost estimations to identify potential cost drivers and risks. 
  - **Regular Cost Monitoring** - Regularly monitor project expenses to identify deviations from the budget and take corrective actions.
  - **Proactive Risk Management** - Implement strategies to mitigate cost-related risks, such as identifying cost-saving opportunities or negotiating better pricing agreements.

> e.g. 
>
> The project budget is limited to $200,000, which includes expenses for software licenses, hardware, salaries, and other resources.

###### 2.6. Time Constraints

> Project deadlines and time constraints directly impact project planning and execution.

- Method to deal
  - **Clear Deadlines** - Establish clear and realistic deadlines for project milestones to maintain focus and avoid delays.
  - **Detailed Schedules** - Develop detailed project schedules, breaking down tasks into smaller manageable chunks, to ensure timely completion.
  - **Resource Allocation** - Allocate resources efficiently, considering the availability of skilled personnel and equipment, to meet project deadlines.
- Challenges in scheduling
  - **Unpredictable Development Issues** - Unexpected technical challenges or bugs can disrupt project timelines.
  - **Scope Creep**

> e.g. 
>
> The software must be developed and released within six months to align with market demands and upcoming industry events.

###### 2.7. Scope Creep

- Definition

  The uncontrolled expansion of project scope, often leading to delays, increased costs, and diminished quality. 

  It occurs when additional features, functionalities, or requirements are added to the project without proper planning or authorization

- Preventing scope creep

  - **Establish Clear Communication Channels** - Open communication with stakeholders is essential for identifying potential scope changes early and addressing them proactively.
  - **Use Change Control Processes** - Implement a formal change control process that requires stakeholder approval for any changes to the project scope. This helps prevent unauthorized changes from derailing the project.
  - **Regularly Review Requirements** - Regularly reviewing and updating project requirements helps identify potential scope creep and address it before it becomes a significant issue.

- Recognizing

  - **Analyze Project Requirements** - Thoroughly review and analyze project requirements to clearly define the boundaries of the project scope.

  - **Document Exclusions** - Clearly document what is not included in the project scope to avoid confusion and potential scope creep.
  - **Monitor Requirements Changes** - Regularly monitor requirements changes and assess their impact on the project scope.

> e.g.
>
> The project is limited to developing a mobile application with specific features, excluding additional functionalities to stay within the agreed-upon scope.

###### 2.8. Quality Constraints

- Definition

  Ensure that the project's deliverables meet specified standards and expectations

- What to do

  - **Define Quality Standards** - Establish clear quality standards and expectations for the project's deliverables. These standards should align with project goals, stakeholder requirements, and industry best practices.
  - **Implement Quality Assurance Processes** - Implement rigorous quality assurance processes to identify and rectify defects, ensuring that the software meets the defined quality standards.
  - **Continuous Testing** - Employ continuous testing throughout the development process to detect and resolve issues early, preventing them from becoming costly defects in later stages.

>e.g.
>
>The development team consists of three software engineers and one UX/UI designer, and additional hiring is not possible due to budget limitations, impacting the available skill set and workforce.

#### 3. Leadership & Authority

###### 3.1. Definition

- `Formal Authority` - The authority provided **by an organization or the law** to an individual 
  - Enabling them to carry out certain actions in accordance with their own will, and
  - Without the need to consult others.
  - **Role** - Typically associated with traditional, hierarchical organizations where power is top-down.
- `Informal Authority` - The authority that **a manager holds over their subordinates** due to certain qualities that the subordinates value in them.
  - **Role** - Is becoming increasingly important in networked, pluralistic organizations that need to rapidly adapt in a complex world.

###### 3.2. Lack of Authority

- Recognizing
  - A lack of **formal authority** - when there is confusion about roles and responsibilities, disagreements about who has the decision-making power, and risks and issues are not being formally managed.
  - A lack of **informal authority** - when there is a lack of admiration, credibility, respect, and trust among team members.
- Impact
  - Lack of **formal authority** can lead to
    - unclear responsibilities, 
    - stalled progress, 
    - unmanaged risks, and 
    - scope creep.
  - Lack of **informal authority** can lead to
    - reduced influence over attitudes and behaviors, and 
    - a lack of conformity with acceptance.

###### 3.3. Four Foundational Behaviors in Project Management

- Contents

  1. Not buying your story (lacking conviction and integrity)
  2. Being tone-deaf (using inappropriate language and humor)
  3. Disowning your accountability (ducking responsibility)
  4. Isolating yourself (the leader is rarely seen as they spend most of the time in their office)

- Benefits

  - Help build informal authority by 

    establishing the project manager as a credible, respectful, and accountable leader who is constantly present and communicating with the team.

- Applying the Four Foundational Behaviors

  - To apply these behaviors in practical situations, a **project manager** should
    1. communicate with conviction and integrity, 
    2. use appropriate language, 
    3. take responsibility for their actions and words, and 
    4. be a constant presence by managing by wandering around.
