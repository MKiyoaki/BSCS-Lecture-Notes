### 1. Definitions

##### 1'.1. Introduction AI

- AI

  - Definition
    - A system is intelligent if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from a human’s.
  - Ways of encoding knowledge
    - **Model-Based**
    - **Data-Driven**
- Agent
  - Definition
    - A unit that makes an intelligent decision when given the opportunity.
    - Uses knowledge it has at that point in time to make decision.
    - Decision limited by range of actions possible at that point in time.

  - Types
    - **Autonomous agent** - makes decisions <u>without human input</u>.

    - **Rational agent** - always takes the <u>best action at a given point</u>.

##### 1'.2. Heuristic Methods

- Definition
  - A rule of thumb that gives us useful information about our distance to the goal state. 
  - A technique designed <u>for problem solving more quickly</u>
    - when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or 
    - when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. 
- Property
  - Admissibility

    - A heuristic function is said to be **admissible** (or an **admissible heuristic** ) if it never over-estimates the cost of reaching the goal. 
    - i.e., <u>The actual distance is always >= than the heuristic value (the cost it estimates to reach the goal)</u> 
  - Optimality - Given an admissible heuristic A\* will find optimal solutions

    - A heuristic that assigns $0$ to each node is **admissible**, but recreates uniform cost search (as it does not provide any real guidance). 
    - Often we **relax** the constraints of the problem to come up with useful heuristics.

  - Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstra Search)
    - Using Best-first Search Idea.

##### 2'.2. Constraint Satisfication Problem (CSP)

- Definition

  - Components
    - A finite set of variables $X = \{x^1, ..., x^i\}$
    - A set of domains $D = \{D^1, ..., D^i\}$
      - Defines what possible values can be assigned <u>to each variable</u>, where the colors can be represented as $\{v^1, ..., v^j\}$
    - A set of constraints $C = \{C^1, ..., C^k\}$
      - The rules that dicate a relation <u>between variables</u> in $X$. 
  - Goal - Finding assignment methods for variables

- Solving CSP
  - Process
    - States
    - Initial State
    - Action
      - Assign a value to any unassigned variable, provided it does not violate a constraint. 
      - If no legal assignments, return **failure**. 
    - Goal Test - Need all variables are assigned values, satisfying all constraints. 

  - Algorithm
  
    - Backtracking Search
  
    - Optimization
  
      - By heuristic methods
  
        - Choosing Variables
          1. Choosing **most constrained variables** (variables with least available values within the domain). 
          2. Choosing **most constraining variables** (variables with most edges or constraints with other variables). 
  
        - Choosing Values
          1. Choosing the least contraining value (values that effect least for other variables). 
  
      - Forward checking
  
        - Terminate search when any variable has no legal values.
        - Forward checking only detects constraints *early*. 
  
      - Constraint Propagation
  
        - Enforces constraints. When assigning a value for a variable,  deleting values for the neighbour variables. 
        - Arc Consistency
          - Detects failure earlier than forward checking.

  - Definition
  - Algorithm

      - Iteratively update and merge. 

    - Hierachical Clustering Algorithm
      - Initially start with n clusters, if there are n data points in total. 


##### 3'.2. Supervised Learning

- Linear Regression
  - Definition
  - Simple Linear Regression Algorithm - Assuming the function is in the formula of $y=ax+b$
    - Assuming an error value for each giving data points, denoted by $\epsilon_i$​. 
    - Taking the data into the formula $y_i = ax_i + b + \epsilon_i$ to get a formula for error value. 
    - Calculating the **Sum of Squared Error (SSE)**, i.e., $\sum\limits_{i=0}^i \epsilon_i^2$, which is a function with two variables $a, b$.
      - Assuming $a$ is a variable and $b$ is a constant, do partial derivation to find a proper $a$ that can minimise the SSE value.
      - Assuming $b$ is a variable and $a$ is a constant, do the same operation. 

    - Then you can get the result of $y=ax+b$.
